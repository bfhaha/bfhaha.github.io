<h1>聽歌學狄克森片語</h1>

<p>本書介紹</p>

<ul>
<li>狄克森片語，原書名為Essential Idioms in English，作者為Robert J. Dixson，所以在台灣稱為狄克森片語。全書共分三個等級，初級beginning，中級intermediate，高級advanced，初級有13課，中級有14課，高級有12課，共39課，每課有12個片語。<br><br></li>
<li>片語是許多學生學習英文的難關之一，有些片語比長單字更難背，片語中兩個拆開的字都知道個別的意思，但放在一起意思就變了。本書希望能藉由歌曲旋律不容易忘記的特性，來幫助讀者記下這些難記的片語。<br><br></li>
<li>這裡只有提供初級。<br><br></li>
<li>市面上雖然已經有很多聽歌學英文的書，那作者出版此書的價值何在呢？目前市面上的這類書，都是先選定幾首歌，再介紹歌曲中的單字，缺點就是沒辦法學習到學校規定要學的單字。<font color="red">本書最大的不同，就是反過來，先決定要學習的片語，再回頭挑選好聽而且包含此片語的歌曲。</font><br><br></li>
<li>原本要出版成書，不過朋友不看好，所以直接放到網路上。<br><br></li>


</ul>




<p>使用方法</p>

<ul>
<li>每一首歌用分隔線隔開，然後以片語為標題，然後是意思、網址、歌手、歌名、備註的項目列表，最後是歌詞。如果同一個片語有好幾首歌，就重複上面的項目列表及歌詞。<br><br></li>
<li>整首歌背下來太花時間，建議只背目標片語出現的段落。<br><br></li>
<li>先瞭解整首歌的歌詞意思，（英文老師可以將這部分作為上課內容，）然後背下目標片語出現的段落，（不用背整首歌，）在未來遇到目標片語的時候，回想起這段歌詞，藉由歌詞來回憶目標片語的意思。<br><br></li>
<li>建議老師可以將全部歌曲下載後給學生放在手機裡面隨身聽，老師也可以指定需要學生記憶的片語。<br><br></li>
<li>每兩天背一個片語，一年就可以背完一冊，剛好國中三年或高中三年可以背完。沒背完的部分也可以隨時繼續，不會有銜接的問題。<br><br></li>


</ul>


<p>其他</p>

<ul>

<li>這些歌曲都是筆者從網路上聽了大量歌曲篩選出來的，有很多歌都是「underrated」，就是非常好聽、完全不輸那些大紅大紫的歌，卻得到很少的關注。有些歌曲乍聽可能覺得不好聽，但多聽幾次就會覺得好聽了。<br><br></li>

</ul>
<br><br>
</li>

<li>有些片語選了好幾首歌，有些是因為都很好聽，有些是因為出現頻率低或是沒有很好聽，多選幾首來加強記憶。小節後面標註星號*的意思就是該片語在歌曲中出現的頻率太低，多選幾首歌來彌補。<br><br></li>

<li>這本書並沒有放歌詞翻譯，主要原因是翻譯本身就是一門專業，再加上歌詞這種東西，有時候意思是很模糊的或是可以做不同的解讀，讀者不妨想想你喜歡的中文歌，然後試圖翻成英文，就可以理解到上面的情形。所以同學們如果問老師歌詞的意思，老師沒辦法給你們滿意的答案，
也不要責怪老師，繼續努力學習，或許就能對歌詞有更深的體會。<br><br></li>


<li>備註的部分是介紹一些歌曲的背景。<br><br></li>


<li>最後，希望這些好聽的歌曲能夠幫助讀者更有效率地學習英文，讀者如果有因為這本書而克服了記憶片語的困難，或是被哪一首好聽的歌所感動，都歡迎寫信跟我分享，作者我會很開心的。有什麼問題或建議也歡迎寫信給作者bfhaha@gmail.com。<br><br></li>
<li>有一些歌曲想要重選，不過作者已為了五斗米折腰，沒時間做了。<br><br></li>

<h3>to get on</h3>



<ul>
<li>意思：上車</li> <li>網址：<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UWnZlkKT8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_UWnZlkKT8</a></li> <li>歌手：Cedarmont Kids</li> <li>歌名：Get on board</li> <li>備註：宗教歌曲。考考讀者，train在這裡的意思為信主耶穌基督。這個版本讀者覺得旋律比較好聽，可惜這個版本少了一段歌詞：<br> The fare is cheap<br>
And all can go<br>
The rich and poor are there<br>
No second class aboard the train<br>
No difference in the fare<br>
筆者覺得這段歌詞是這首歌的重點，引申為不分貧賤，每個人都可以信主，有這段歌詞的版本參考這裡<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlIw-e1ClVk">註</a>。

<li>歌詞：<br>


I live on an apartment<br>
On the ninety-ninth floor of my block<br>
And I sit at home looking out the window<br>
Imagining the world has stopped<br>
Then in flies a guy<br>
Who's all dressed up just like the Union Jack<br>
And says, I've won five pounds<br>
If I have his kind of detergent pack<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
I said, "Hey, you, <mark>get off</mark> of my cloud<br>
Hey, you, <mark>get off</mark> of my cloud<br>
Hey, you, <mark>get off</mark> of my cloud<br>
Don't hang around cause two's a crowd<br>
On my cloud baby"<br>
<br>
The telephone is ringing<br>
I say, "Hi, it's me, who is it there on the line?"<br>
A voice says, "Hi, hello, how are you?"<br>
Well, I guess I'm doing fine<br>
It's three a.m., there's too much noise<br>
Don't you people ever want to go to bed<br>
Because you feel so good<br>
Do you have to drive me out of my head<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
I was sick and tired, fed up with this<br>
And decided to take a drive downtown<br>
It was so very quiet and peaceful<br>
There was nobody, not a soul around<br>
I laid myself out<br>
I was so tired and I started to dream<br>
In the morning the parking tickets were just like a flag<br>
Stuck on my windscreen<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
Hey, you, <mark>get off</mark> of my cloud<br>
Hey, you, <mark>get off</mark> of my cloud<br>
Hey, you, <mark>get off</mark> of my cloud<br>
Don't hang around, baby two's a crowd<br>
On my cloud<br>

<li>意思：穿（衣服）</li> <li>網址：<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_CE7GqqrvY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_CE7GqqrvY</a></li> <li>歌手：Dick Van Dyke</li> <li>歌名：Put on a happy face</li> <li>備註：put off不是脫衣的意思，put off是延遲的意思，take off才是脫衣。這首歌是音樂劇Bye Bye Birdie的插曲。</li> 
<li>歌詞：<br>

Why look so awfully tragic<br>
<mark>Put on</mark> a happy face<br>
Smiling can work like magic<br>
<mark>Put on</mark> a happy face<br>
Take off the gloomy mask of tragedy<br>
It's not your style<br>
You look so good<br>
That you'll be glad<br>
You've decided to smile<br>
<br>
Pick out a pleasant outlook<br>
Stick out that noble chin<br>
Wipe off the full of doubt look<br>
Slap on a happy grin<br>
Hands spread sunshine<br>
All over the place<br>
Just <mark>put on</mark> a happy face<br>
<br>
Flowers?<br>
<mark>Put on</mark> a happy face<br>
<mark>Put on</mark> a happy face<br>
Why do you mope around so sourly?<br>
It's such a string<br>
I always try to chuckle hourly<br>
It clears the brain<br>
<br>
I knew a girl so gloomy<br>
She'd never laugh or sing<br>
She wouldn't listen to me<br>
Now she's a mean old thing<br>
<br>
So spread sunshine all over the place<br>
<mark>Put on</mark> a happy<br>
<br>
So <mark>put on</mark> a happy face<br>
<br>

<li>意思：脫（衣服）</li> <li>網址：<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVQjGlS7dqs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVQjGlS7dqs</a></li> <li>歌手：Ezra Furman</li> <li>歌名：Take off your sunglasses</li> <li>備註：這部MV可以幫助記憶，因為男主角就戴著太陽眼鏡。take on不是穿衣服的意思，take on是負責的意思。歌詞中，
女主角叫男主角脫掉太陽眼鏡，
但男主角不想，
隱喻男主角不想面對現實。</li>

So you finally got the nerve to ask that little girl<br>
You've been diggin' on if she wants to go out<br>
She said yes, now you're wanting to impress<br>
But you ain't got no Casanova know-how<br>
<br>
You ain't gotta read a book to get her on the hook<br>
She's a country baby through and through<br>
If you wanna do her right on a Saturday night<br>
This is all you've gotta do<br>
<br>

<mark>Pick</mark> her <mark>up</mark> in a pickup truck<br>
Take her out to a honky-tonk<br>

Yeah buddy, she ain't got no use for a BMW<br>
Or wine from a hundred-dollar bottle<br>
She'd rather bounce around on the outskirts of town<br>
Shotgunnin' in a muddy Silverado<br>
<br>
If you're gonna have a chance at closin' time romance<br>
Flip the switch on the neon hard<br>
Don't forget the first step before you get to two steps<br>
Knowin' right where to start<br>

<ul>
<li>意思：to arise, to rise from a bed; to make someone arise</li> <li>網址：<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70FVFxXpY_8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70FVFxXpY_8</a></li> <li>歌手：Irving Berlin</li> <li>歌名：Oh how I hate to get up in the morning</li> <li>備註：歌詞中很有趣的一段是Someday I'm going to murder the bugler，bugler是軍隊中吹起床號的喇叭手，意思類似於你一大早被人吵醒，然後心裡咒罵說：「我要宰了他。」這首歌出現在1943年電影This is the Army中，1:55左右。</li> 
<li>歌詞：<br>

I've been a soldier quite a while<br>
And I would like to state<br>
The life is simply wonderful<br>
The Army food is great<br>
I sleep with ninety-seven others in a wooden hut<br>
I love them all<br>
They all love me<br>
It's very lovely but<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
Oh! How I hate to <mark>get up</mark> in the morning<br>
Oh! How I'd love to remain in bed<br>
For the hardest blow of all<br>
Is to hear the bugler call<br>
Ya gotta <mark>get up</mark><br>
Ya gotta <mark>get up</mark><br>
Ya gotta <mark>get up</mark> this morning<br>
Someday I'm going to murder the bugler<br>
Someday they're going to find him dead<br>
<br>
I'll amputate his reveille<br>
And step upon it heavily<br>
And spend the rest of my life in bed<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
<br>
And then I'll get that other pup<br>
The guy who wakes the bugler up<br>
And spend the rest of my life in bed<br>

And win back your love<br>
Give me one more day<br>
To try my love<br>
<br>
Give me one more day<br>
To put up a fight<br>
Give me one more day<br>
To take back the night<br>

With all of my might<br>
Give me one more day<br>
To put up a fight<br>

Give me one more day<br>
To look in your eyes<br>
Give me one more day<br>
To make you realize<br>

Give me one more day<br>

Don't know much about practicing what I preach,<br>
Don't know how to be envious without jealousy,<br>
Don't know how to hold my temper, when I have to get in the last word,<br>
Don't know how to speak softly and still be heard,<br>

God if you're listening would you <mark>come up with</mark> some change?<br>
Cause I wake up every morning with a penny to my name.<br>

Don't know much about love cause I get the same crap from every guy,<br>
Don't know how to see the grass being greener on my side,<br>

Whoa man, I'm everything I said I wouldn't be,<br>
Standing here with nothing, will you help me?<br>
Don't know how to tell a joke without putting my foot in my mouth,<br>
Don't know how to be intimate if I don't have a crowd,<br>
Don't know how to be hopeful, what if they let me down?<br>
I don't know how to keep myself from hurting everyone...<br>

Chinese lanterns twinkle in bright<br>
Now what was the tune that big band was crooning<br>
Must have been love <mark>at first</mark> sight<br>

Dawn for the stars to flight<br>
Honeysuckle breeze whispering leaves<br>
Must have been love <mark>at first</mark> sight<br>

(C) By now we had a while<br>
To look each other over<br>
We've seen what time could bring two lovers<br>
That night at the lake was no mistake<br>

See if you can relate to this one<br>

Hope I'm not disturbing you<br>
Because you look into thought right now<br>
I don't mean to be rude<br>

Can I take you out<br>
I feel that if I don't ask chance will pass<br>
And I'll never see your face again,<br>
I'll never see your face again. No<br>

You maybe thinking I am strange<br>
Not every single day, no, beauty comes my way, so<br>

To love, love <mark>at first</mark> sight.<br>

<li>歌詞：<br>

Made plans with me and all your friends<br>
I'm late again, I hate to keep you waiting<br>
Tried to be a gentleman, got drunk again before I even made it<br>
Tried to call a car for you, you're tired of me<br>
I know you wouldn't take it<br>
You walked a mile in Louis Vuittons and fucked 'em up<br>
You know that they're my favorite<br>
<br>
(A)<br>
But we dress up and play pretend<br>
Then we act like we're good again<br>
I do things I can't defend<br>
And even when you hold it in<br>
<br>
(B)<br>
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly<br>
Explosions hidden when we're in the open<br>
Keep on smilin' until it's over<br>
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly<br>
<br>
Arguments that never end<br>
You're talkin' shit to spice up conversation<br>
I'm so sick of back and forth<br>
These fights with you are startin' to feel contagious<br>
Said that I'm no good for you<br>
Right before we walk into your parents<br>
Then you put on that smile again<br>
And grab my hand even though you hate it<br>
<br>
(A)<br>
<br>
(B)<br>
<br>
Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said<br>
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't<br>
Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said<br>
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't<br>
<br>
(B)<br>
<br>
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly<br>
(Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said<br>
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't)<br>
Explosions hidden when we're in the open<br>
(Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said<br>
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't)<br>
Keep on smilin' until it's over<br>
(Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said<br>
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't)<br>

One day is lots like another<br>
When you expect the same old same<br>
So true and telling your brother<br>
Just don't play that game<br>
You have tomorrow to run to<br>
So don't be stuck in yesterday<br>
Why not embrace the one who loves you come what may?<br>
In a minute life can unwind you<br>
That's when love will find you and lead the way<br>
<br>
<mark>At last</mark> you're looking at me<br>
<mark>At last</mark> you're finally free<br>

To live each day with love for all to see<br>
The past is in the past<br>
<mark>At last</mark> it's me<br>

Too long we see our reflection<br>
Too long it's all that we ever know<br>
But be strong<br>
Reverse your direction and watch your power grow<br>
There's life in all that's around you<br>
You only have to let it in<br>
You'll be so glad that it found you<br>
Your new day will begin<br>
Today will last me forever<br>
Cause today I'm the best I've ever been<br>

You know so I couldn't agree more that are exactly my thought as well.<br>
They always say that the grass will grow much greener on the other side.<br>
All I can say is now I know I've been there and the road is too wide.<br>

I've had a glimpse from another point of view.<br>

(A)<br>
Run your car off the side of the road<br>
Get stuck in a ditch way out in the middle of nowhere<br>
Get yourself in a bind, lose the shirt off your back<br>
Need a floor, need a couch, need a bus fare<br>
<br>
This is where the rubber meets the road<br>
This is where the cream is gonna rise<br>
This is what you really didn't know<br>
This is where the truth don't lie<br>

You <mark>find out</mark> who your friends are<br>
Somebody's gonna drop everything<br>
Run out and crank up their car<br>
Hit the gas get their fast<br>
Never stop to think 'what's in it for me?' or 'it's way too far.'<br>
They just show on up with their big old heart<br>
You <mark>find out</mark> who you're friends are<br>
<br>
Everybody wants to slap your back<br>
Wants to shake your hand<br>
When you're up on top of that mountain<br>
But let one of those rocks give way then you slide back down look up<br>
And see who's around then<br>
<br>
This ain't where the road comes to an end<br>
This ain't where the bandwagon stops<br>
This is just one of those times when<br>
A lot of folks jump off<br>

<mark>Look at</mark> you wearin' my hat<br>
You know I love it when you flip it 'round back<br>
I been wearin' it all summer long<br>
And it ain't ever looked like that girl<br>
<mark>Look at</mark> you singing that song<br>
I used to turn it off when it came on<br>
Now it's my favourite when you start singing it<br>
Can't help singing along<br>
'Cause you turn ordinary everyday things<br>
Into something beautiful 'cause you're beautiful<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
Girl I love to <mark>look at</mark> you<br>
Walking out the front door<br>
Hopping in my front seat<br>
Sliding over close to me<br>
Yeah, I love to <mark>look at</mark> you<br>
When you're with your girlfriends<br>
Laughin' 'bout your dancing<br>
Out there making eyes at me<br>
Girl I love to <mark>look at</mark> you<br>
Just <mark>look at</mark> you<br>
<br>
Yeah I love to <mark>look at</mark> you<br>
Just <mark>look at</mark> you<br>
<br>
<mark>Look at</mark> you drinkin' that drink<br>
Little bit spicy, little bit sweet<br>
When you bite your lip and you take a sip<br>
Girl you know you what you're making me think, yeah<br>
<mark>Look at</mark> you turning it on<br>
Bet you you could have any boy that you want<br>
<mark>Look at</mark> you making every girl in the room wanna run and put some makeup on<br>
'Cause you turn ordinary everyday things<br>
Into something beautiful cause you're beautiful<br>

Everything and more you said<br>

And show my face for the world to see<br>
Gonna see me<br>
And I'ma call every girl that turned me down<br>
And tell 'em now that<br>
I'm just too busy<br>
'Cause I don't have the time<br>

I know, I know what's on your mind<br>
And I know it gets tough sometimes.<br>
But you can give it one more try to find another reason why,<br>
You should pick it up and try it again<br>
<br>

Cause it's not too late for that too late for me.<br>
<br>
I know I've been hurt before<br>
And I know I really shouldn't give any more.<br>
But this time, this time things seem just a little different.<br>
And when I look in your eyes, you know I can see that it's true.<br>
And I hear you say:<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
<br>
Cause it's not too late for that too late for that.<br>
<br>
Just when you feel helpless, <br>
nothing left to say.<br>
Love will find us. <br>
The past behind us then we're on our way.<br>
<br>
Time and time again I see <br>
people so unsure like me,<br>
We all know it gets heard sometimes <br>
You can give it one more try,<br>
Find another reason why you should pick it up,<br>
You should kick it up and try it again.<br>

Time just drifts away<br>

Your love has been there <mark>all along</mark><br>

Every joy and pain had a reason of its own<br>

The changing seasons of my life<br>
Were not left up to chance<br>

We the people fight for our existence<br>
We don't claim to be perfect but we're free<br>
We dream our dreams alone with no resistance<br>
Fading like the stars we wish to be<br>

But my God woke up on the wrong side of his bed<br>
<br>
And it just don't matter now<br>

As <mark>little by little</mark> we gave you everything you ever dreamed of<br>
<mark>Little by little</mark> the wheels of your life have slowly fallen off<br>

And all the time I just ask myself why you're really here?<br>
<br>
True perfection has to be imperfect<br>
I know that that sounds foolish but it's true<br>
Day has come, now you'll have to accept<br>
Life inside your head we give to you<br>
You know I didn't mean what I just said<br>
But my God woke up on the wrong side of his bed<br>

And it just don't matter now<br>

Keeps me seeking all around<br>
Moving on from town to town<br>

I heard that you're settled down<br>
That you found a girl and you're married now<br>

Guess she gave you things, I didn't give to you<br>
Old friend, why are you so shy?<br>
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light<br>
<br>
(A)<br>
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited<br>
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it<br>
I had hoped you'd see my face<br>
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over<br>

My love she speaks like silence<br>
Without ideals or violence<br>
She doesn't have to say she's faithful<br>
Yet she's true, like ice, like fire<br>
<br>
People carry roses<br>
And make promises by the hours<br>
My love she laughs like the flowers<br>
Valentines can't buy her<br>
<br>
In the dime stores and bus stations<br>
People <mark>talk over</mark> situations<br>
Read books, repeat quotations<br>
Draw conclusions on the wall<br>
<br>
Some speak of the future<br>
My love she speaks softly<br>
She knows there's no success like failure<br>
And that failure's no success at all<br>
<br>
The cloak and dagger dangles<br>
Madams light the candles<br>
In ceremonies of the horsemen<br>
Even the pawn must hold a grudge<br>
<br>
Statues made of matchsticks<br>
Crumble into one another<br>
My love winks, she does not bother<br>
She knows too much to argue or to judge<br>
<br>
The bridge at midnight trembles<br>
The country doctor rambles<br>
Bankers' nieces seek perfection<br>
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring<br>
<br>
The wind howls like a hammer<br>
The night blows rainy<br>
My love she's like some raven<br>
At my window with a broken wing<br>

<li>歌詞：<br>

All you who love darkness instead of true light,<br>
Who dare not yourselves show, except in the night.<br>
Lament your sad loss, let the news spread afar,<br>
The great overthrow of The Northern Star.<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Derry down down, derry down down,<br>
Derry down, derry down, croppies <mark>lie down</mark>.<br>
<br>
In the County of Wexford these rebels did rise,<br>
All brave Orange-men they swore they'd sacrifice;<br>
They thought that our army they surely would beat,<br>
But we boldly attacked them, and made them retreat.<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
On Vinegar Hill then those rebels did camp,<br>
They thought by their numbers our army would cramp;<br>
But we boldly attacked them and forced them to yield,<br>
And five hundred croppies lay dead on the field.<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
The bold General Dundas is a man of great might,<br>
He attacked all the croppies just at the day-light;<br>
He threw up his bomb-shells and bullets so fast,<br>
And put the damned croppies all flying at last.<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
Colonel Campbell, commanding the first light brigade,<br>
He forced up the hill when the attack it was made,<br>
And planted his cannon in such a fine spot,<br>
And made the wild croppies to curse his grape shot.<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
These rebels they thought our command to seduce,<br>
They sent out McManus with a white flag of truce;<br>
They thought that the army good terms they would give,<br>
But the answer was, 'croppies, we won't let you live'.<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
Then Esmond and Kay all with Harvey and Hay,<br>
Unto General Moore were given up the next day;<br>
They were tried by court-martial, them quickly we slew,<br>
And that put an end to the blood-thirsty crew.<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>

I dreamed last night I got on the boat to heaven<br>
And by some chance I had brought my dice along<br>
And there I stood<br>
And I hollered "Someone fade me"<br>
But the passengers, they knew right from wrong.<br>
<br>
For the people all said <mark>sit down</mark>, <mark>sit down</mark>, you're rockin' the boat<br>
People all said <mark>sit down</mark><br>
<mark>Sit down</mark> you're rockin' the boat.<br>
And the devil will drag you under<br>
By the sharp lapel of your checkered coat,<br>
<mark>Sit down</mark>, <mark>sit down</mark>, <mark>sit down</mark>, <mark>sit down</mark>,<br>
<mark>Sit down</mark> you're rockin' the boat.<br>
<br>
I sailed away on that little boat to heaven<br>
And by some chance found a bottle in my fist<br>
And there I stood, Nicely passin' out the whisky<br>
But the passengers were bound to resisist<br>
<br>
For the people all said beware<br>
You're on a heavenly trip<br>
People all said beware<br>
Beware, you'll scuttle the ship.<br>
And the devil will drag you under<br>
By the fancy tie 'round your wicked throat<br>
<mark>Sit down</mark>, <mark>sit down</mark>, <mark>sit down</mark>, <mark>sit down</mark><br>
<mark>Sit down</mark>, you're rockin' the boat<br>
<br>
And as I laughed at those passengers to heaven (laughs)<br>
(Gasps!) A great big wave came and washed me over board!<br>
And as I sank And I hollered "someone save me!"<br>
That's the moment I woke up Thank the lord<br>
<br>
And I said to myself, <mark>sit down</mark>, <mark>sit down</mark>,<br>
You're rockin' the boat!<br>
Said to myself <mark>sit down</mark>, <mark>sit down</mark>, you're rockin' the boat<br>

I love the holly and the mistletoe<br>

I love the ribbons and the candy-canes<br>
The giant stocking with the glittering mane<br>
The gingerbread smell and the jingling bells<br>
If I had my way<br>

And shouted, dad have no fear<br>
As I stretched high to store the stockings and trim<br>
In the attic for another year<br>

God's longing to reconcile<br>
How He gave to the world the gift of new life<br>

We will never store his blessed gift away<br>

I know this me and you thing<br>
Is a new thing<br>
And I'd be lying if I said this is what I was looking for<br>
I kinda can't stop thinking<br>
That leaving is the last thing I wanna be doing right now for sure<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Maybe I'll oversleep<br>
And miss my flight<br>
My alarm went off at 6:05<br>
But I never heard it<br>
Accidentally <mark>on purpose</mark><br>
Maybe I'd lay you with just like this<br>
And give you one more goodbye kiss<br>
And slip those three little words in<br>
Accidentally <mark>on purpose</mark><br>
<br>
I never thought you'd call<br>
So, I guess it's your fault<br>
I wasn't trying to fall<br>
But you and my heart were making other plans<br>
But here I am crazy about you<br>
Not ready for a day without you<br>
Here I am saying 'what the hell?'<br>
Wide awake telling myself<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
What if I stay?<br>
What would you say?<br>
<br>
I know this me and you thing<br>
Is a new thing<br>
But leaving is the last thing I wanna be doing right now<br>
<br>

Accidentally I saw you this morning <br>
you were lovely dressed in your wedding gown<br>
And they say that you married a stranger to me <br>
that had drifted to our old hometown<br>
<br>
Accidentally you've met him one evening <br>
and you say it was love at first sight<br>
Accidentally <mark>on purpose</mark> you've married <br>
accidentally <mark>on purpose</mark> for spite<br>

Cause I saw you out cheating and running around<br>
And I was just a fool with a heart of a clown<br>
Accidentally you were mistaken that night <br>

Feeling like I'm stuck in a hole<br>
Body and soul<br>
While you're out of control<br>
Now I know why you had to go<br>
Well I think we both know<br>
That it had to be so<br>
<br>
I've been trying not to cry<br>
When I'm in the public eye<br>
Stuck here with the shame <br>
And taking my share of the blame <br>
While making sudden plans that don't include you<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
I <mark>get along</mark>, <mark>get along</mark><br>
Without you very well<br>
I <mark>get along</mark> very well<br>
I <mark>get along</mark>, <mark>get along</mark><br>
Without you very well<br>
I <mark>get along</mark> very well<br>
<br>
Now I know you'd much rather be<br>
With rock royalty<br>
Instead of someone like me<br>
The big boys are back and we need them, you said<br>
Think it was something you'd read<br>
And it stuck in your head<br>
<br>
Even though I don't suppose<br>
That's as far as it goes<br>
You've got quite an appetite<br>
For being wronged and in the right<br>
Well from now on it won't affect me<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
The morning after the night before<br>
I'd been alerted<br>
To your lies<br>
I phoned you up<br>
The calls were all diverted<br>
Took a long time to track you down<br>
Even then you were defiant<br>
It's not what you think it is, you said<br>
And proceeded to deny it<br>

I went all the way to Paris to forget your face<br>
Captured in stained glass, young lives long since passed<br>
Statues of lovers every place<br>
I went all across the continent to relieve this restless love<br>
I walked through the ruins, icons of glory<br>
Smashed by the bombs from above<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
So we must love while these moments are still called today<br>
<mark>Take part in</mark> the pain of this passion play<br>
Stretching our youth as we must, until we are ashes to dust<br>
Until time makes history of us<br>
<br>
Jeu de Paume's full of faces knowing peace, knowing strife<br>
Leisure and toil, still it's canvas and oil<br>
There's just no medium for life<br>
In the midst of the rubble i felt a sense of rebirth<br>
In a dusty cathedral the living god called<br>
And i prayed for my life here on earth<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
<br>
There are mountains in Switzerland, brilliant cold as they stand<br>
From my hotel room, watching the half-moon<br>
Bleeding its light like a lamb<br>
And the town is illumined, its tiny figures are fast asleep<br>
And it dawns on me the time is upon me<br>
To return to the flock i must keep<br>

Walkin' down the street again.<br>
Just like it's always been.<br>
Just another ordinary day.<br>
Got your head phones in your ear.<br>
People talkin' but you can't hear.<br>
You keep on keepin' on your way.<br>
<br>
Lookin' at your feet, walkin' to the beat,<br>
missin' ev'rybody that you could meet<br>
You stepped outside your own little world.<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
You gotta <mark>look up</mark>.<br>
<mark>Look up</mark>, yeah, you gotta <mark>look up</mark><br>
a little bit higher<br>
if you really want to shoot for the stars.<br>
You gotta <mark>look up</mark>.<br>
<mark>Look up</mark>, yeah<br>
You gotta <mark>look up</mark> and start a little fire in your heart..<br>
Believe me you'll go far<br>
You gotta <mark>look up</mark>.<br>
<br>
Get to where you're try'n to go.<br>
See somebody that you don't know<br>
who's sittin' there just lookin' at the ground<br>
You fin'ly turn the music off.<br>
You take a seat, you start to talk.<br>
You find it turns the day around.<br>
<br>
Go the extra mile. Listen for a while<br>
When you walk away you can't help<br>
but smile 'cause you<br>
stepped outside your own little world.<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
<mark>Look up</mark> a little more.<br>
You gotta <mark>look up</mark>.<br>
Look higher than before.<br>
You gotta <mark>look up</mark>.<br>
Raise your head and look to the sky.<br>
<br>
[Chorus]x2<br>
<br>
You gotta <mark>look up</mark>.<br>
Step outside your own little world.<br>

How many roads must a man walk down<br>
Before they call him a man?<br>
How many seas must a white dove sail<br>
Before she sleeps in the sand?<br>
How many times must the cannon balls fly<br>
Before they're forever banned?<br>
<br>
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind<br>
The answer is blowin' in the wind<br>
<br>
How many years must a mountain exist<br>
Before it is washed to the sea?<br>
How many years can some people exist<br>
Before they're allowed to be free?<br>
How many times can a man turn his head<br>
And pretend that he just doesn't see?<br>
<br>
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind<br>
The answer is blowin' in the wind<br>
<br>
How many times must a man <mark>look up</mark><br>
Before he can see the sky?<br>
How many ears must one man have<br>
Before he can hear people cry?<br>
How many deaths will it take 'til he knows<br>

The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind<br>
The answer is blowin' in the wind<br>
The answer is blowin' in the wind<br>

<li>歌詞：<br>

Did Moses know when the branches spoke he would be the chosen one?<br>
Or did his people know that a cloud of smoke would safely lead them home?<br>
Sometimes God will speak through a bush of flames or pillars in the sky,<br>
But at times His silence fills our days leaving us to wonder "Why?”.<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
Sometimes we wait, simply to find<br>
Sometimes His answers come with time,<br>
Not right away clearly to see,<br>
Sometimes we never get those parted seas<br>
That lead us from the shore.<br>
But there is a place<br>
Where we rest in His grace<br>
When sometimes we <mark>wait on</mark> the Lord.<br>
<br>
If I had my way, there would come a day with a never-ending dawn.<br>
No more mournful sighs in the dark of night as I wonder where He's gone.<br>
I would never see how His mercy reigns beneath a cloudless sky.<br>
There would be no need for healing grace to comfort when we cry.<br>
<br>

Hello, it's me<br>
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet<br>
To go over everything<br>
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, <br>
but I ain't done much healing<br>
Hello, can you hear me?<br>
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be<br>
When we were younger and free<br>
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet<br>
There's such a difference between us<br>
And a million miles<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Hello from the other side<br>
I must've called a thousand times<br>
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done<br>
But when I call, you never seem to be home<br>
Hello from the outside<br>
<mark>At least</mark>, I can say that I've tried<br>
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart<br>
But it don't matter, <br>
it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore<br>
<br>
Hello, how are you?<br>
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry<br>
I hope that you're well<br>
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?<br>
It's no secret that the both of us<br>
Are running out of time<br>

I love a sailor, the sailor loves me<br>
And sails every night to my home<br>
He's not a sailor that sails o'er the sea<br>
Or over the wild briny foam<br>
For he owns an airship and sails up on high<br>
He's just like a bird on the wing<br>
And when the shadows of evening draw nigh<br>
He'll sail to my window and sing<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
Come, <mark>take a trip</mark> in my airship<br>
Come, take a sail 'mong the stars<br>
Come, have a ride around Venus<br>
Come, have a spin around Mars<br>
No one to watch while we're kissing<br>
No one to see while we spoon<br>
Come, <mark>take a trip</mark> in my airship<br>
And we'll visit the man in the moon<br>
<br>
One night, while sailing away from the crowds<br>
We passed through the milky white way<br>
Just idly sailing and watching the clouds<br>
He asked me if I'd name the day<br>
And right near the dipper I gave him my heart<br>
The sun shines on our honeymoon<br>
We swore from each other we never would part<br>
And teach all the babies this tune<br>

Head in the clouds<br>
But I can't see the Lord<br>
Short of perfection<br>
I'll try to be good<br>
I'll stand at His gate<br>
I'll wait for His sign<br>
Then I'll walk in His garden<br>
When it's my time<br>
Drink from His cup<br>
Hush now don't you cry<br>
His quiet waters<br>
Will never, never run dry<br>
Nearing death's vale<br>
He's here by my side<br>
He leads me to paradise<br>
A mountain so high<br>
<br>
Don't be afraid<br>
Just treasure His word<br>
Singing His praises<br>
I know that I'll be heard<br>
He's gonna take you by the hand<br>
He's gonna make you feel so good<br>
Open up your eyes<br>
And then you'll see all that you should<br>
Forget all your troubles<br>
You will feel no pain<br>
He's all that you need<br>
He's your everything<br>
When I'm feeling all at sea<br>
Deliverance is that distant shore<br>
I will not be worried<br>
Someday His house will be my home<br>
For ever more<br>

Oh, they all begin to look like movie stars<br>
All the girls all get prettier at closing time<br>
When the change starts <mark>taking place</mark> it puts a glow on every face<br>
Of the fallen angels of the back street bars<br>
<br>
If I could rate them on a scale from one to ten<br>
I'm looking for a nine but eight could work right in<br>
Few more drinks and I might slip to five or even four<br>
But when tomorrow morning comes and I wake up with a number one<br>
I swear I'll never do it anymore<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
<br>
I don't mean to criticize the girls at all<br>
'Cause I'm no Robert Redford even overhauled<br>
But we all picture in our minds a girl that looks just right<br>
Now ain't it funny, ain't it strange the way a man's opinions change<br>
When he starts to face that lonely night<br>
<br>

I was raised on New York rock and roll<br>
I took control, I was cool<br>
Made the rounds made the record hops<br>
I hit the top, played the fool<br>
<br>
From above I truly heard a friend<br>
Truly now you must be born again<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
I <mark>put away</mark> my idols<br>
I stripped away all the titles<br>
Money wrinkles and things do decay<br>
I <mark>put away</mark> my idols<br>
<br>
I was living by my horoscope<br>
Taking pills to cope<br>
With my pain<br>
Rock and roll was my identity<br>
My whole security<br>
I made a name<br>
<br>
Truly from above I heard a friend<br>
Truly now you must be born again<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
Looking back over my years<br>
My story did unfold<br>
I worshiped people and their gifts<br>
Not the gift giver at all<br>
<br>
Well you see<br>
People they've come and gone<br>
But life in Him goes on and on<br>
He's given me a brand new song<br>
To sing<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
Truly now you must be born again<br>
Truly that's the way you will begin<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>

Cadillacs end up in the junkyard<br>
I <mark>put away</mark> my idols<br>

There's a man working in a field<br>
Sees the rain and it's burning<br>
He's saying this can't be real<br>
As he sees the color<br>
Of the fields turning<br>
<br>
Far away, the men too busy<br>
Getting rich to care<br>
Close their eyes and<br>
Let it all out into the air<br>
Hoping nobody else would care<br>

<mark>Look out</mark> any window<br>

To see what's going on<br>
In the air around you<br>
<br>
There's a man working on a boat<br>
Pulling lines from the water<br>
Just trying to stay afloat, ohh<br>
Filling the nets is getting harder<br>
<br>
Far away, they bend<br>
The rules so secretly<br>
Close their eyes and<br>
Let it all out into the sea<br>
Hoping nobody else would see<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
<br>
Far away, too many leaders<br>
Let them get their way<br>
Close their eyes and<br>
Let it all out into the bay<br>
Say they'll clear it up another day<br>

Well, there’s no <mark>getting over</mark>  it,<br>
I’ve got a bad case of SATs blues!<br>

That spelling amnesia is creeping up on me!<br>
It’s either T..H..E..I..R or T..H..E..R..E?<br>

Day after day<br>
I must face a world of strangers<br>
Where I don't belong<br>
I'm not that strong<br>

Who will always care<br>
You're always there<br>

When there's no <mark>getting over</mark> that rainbow<br>
When my smallest of dreams won't come true<br>
I can take all the madness the world has to give<br>

<br>
So many times when the city seems to be<br>
Without a friendly face, a lonely place<br>
It's nice to know that you'll be there if I need you<br>
And you'll always smile, it's all worthwhile<br>

Touch me and I end up singing<br>
Trouble seems to up and disappear<br>
You touch me with the love you're bringing<br>
I can't really lose when you're near<br>
When you're near, my love<br>
<br>
If all my friends have forgotten half their promises<br>
They're not unkind, just hard to find<br>
One look at you<br>
And I know that I could learn to live<br>
Without the rest<br>
I've found the best<br>

Mornings closing in on me, how can I face another dawn<br>
My life lost all meaning, the minute she was gone<br>
I begged and I pleaded, I done all a man can do<br>
I've tried everything lord, now it's time I turned to you<br>
<br>

I know you can move a mountain, take the stars out of the sky<br>
You can send down a rainbow, you can even turn the tide<br>
Once you even made a blind man see, changed the water into wine<br>
I need a miracle, please Jesus, would you <mark>change her mind</mark>?<br>
<br>
When she was here beside me, lord you know how good it was<br>
Who have ever thought back then I could have lost her love?<br>
Now I'm standing here a broken man, I can't make it by myself<br>
I may not be worthy lord, but won't you get me through this hell<br>

I've heard it said<br>
That people come into our lives<br>
For a reason<br>
Bringing something we must learn<br>
And we are led<br>
To those who help us most to grow<br>
If we let them<br>
And we help them in return<br>
Well, I don't know if I believe that's true<br>
But I know I'm who I am today<br>
Because I knew you<br>
<br>
Like a comet pulled from orbit<br>
As it passes a sun<br>
Like a stream that meets a boulder<br>
Halfway through the wood<br>
Who can say if I've been changed for the better?<br>
But because I knew you<br>
I have been changed <mark>for good</mark><br>
<br>
It well may be<br>
That we will never meet again<br>
In this lifetime<br>
So let me say before we part<br>
So much of me<br>
Is made of what I learned from you<br>
You'll be with me<br>
Like a handprint on my heart<br>
And now whatever way our stories end<br>
I know you have re-written mine<br>
By being my friend<br>
<br>
Like a ship blown from its mooring<br>
By a wind off the sea<br>
Like a seed dropped by a skybird<br>
In a distant wood<br>
Who can say if I've been changed for the better?<br>
But because I knew you<br>
Because I knew you<br>
I have been changed <mark>for good</mark><br>
<br>
And just to clear the air<br>
I ask forgiveness<br>
For the things I've done<br>
You blame me for<br>
But then, I guess<br>
We know there's blame to share<br>
And none of it seems to matter anymore<br>
<br>
Like a comet pulled from orbit<br>
(Like a ship blown from its mooring)<br>
As it passes a sun<br>
(By a wind off the sea)<br>
Like a stream that meets a boulder<br>
(Like a seed dropped by a bird)<br>
Halfway through the wood<br>
(In the wood)<br>
Who can say<br>
If I've been changed for the better?<br>
I do believe I have been changed for the better<br>
<br>
And because I knew you<br>
Because I knew you<br>
Because I knew you<br>
I have been changed<br>

I remember my Dad telling me as he was growing old<br>

So many things he planned to do<br>
before his life on Earch was through<br>
and passed him by he failed to take the time<br>

Don't hesitate to live your life be bold<br>
We only get one chance at life so live it<br>
Don't <mark>put off</mark> being young until your old<br>
<br>
Then I grew up and Dad was gone<br>
I had to sign things on my own<br>
My time was spent for family to provide<br>
My little boys most every day said Dad<br>
won't you please come and play<br>
But I didn't need the words Dad said to me<br>

Now I've grown old and all alone<br>
My sons grew up and they are gone<br>

It wasn't long till you had reached the top<br>
But you took so many bows that it's gone to your head<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
So <mark>hang up</mark> your rhinestone suit take out the trash<br>
No matter how great thou art you can still cut the grass<br>
We've got some bills and checks that need your famous autograph<br>
So <mark>hang up</mark> your rhinestone suit and take out the trash<br>
<br>
You'll never meet a fan who'll give ya my support<br>
Don't compare me with those girls in all the towns you've been<br>
Just because I am your wife don't sell me short<br>
When I fell in love with you your ship had not come in<br>
<br>
When you get home from being on the road<br>
You treat me like I am your maid<br>
You never offer words of tenderness<br>
When you take me in your arms you act like you're on stage<br>

It seems like yesterday<br>
I heard the people say<br>
Son, you were born to stray<br>
Someday you'll settle down<br>
I guess there'll come a time<br>
Maybe I'll tow the line<br>
But right now I'm doing fine<br>
Rolling from town to town<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
I don't care where I ride<br>
I'll let my feet decide<br>
Do anything but don't ask that I<br>
<mark>Hang up</mark> my rock and roll shoes<br>
<mark>Hang up</mark> my rock and roll shoes<br>
<br>
Guitars and ringing tones<br>
In my blood and in my bones<br>
Show me a bus and I'll call it home<br>
'Cause I don't wanna change<br>
On a lonely day<br>
When they put me in my grave<br>
Ain't a worry you need to save<br>
Just <mark>hang up</mark> my rock and roll shoes<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
<br>
So let that motor run<br>
Headed out towards the sun<br>
I'm in the mood for moving on<br>
But I'll be back someday<br>
<br>
I don't care where I ride<br>
I'll let my feet decide<br>
Do anything but don't ask that I<br>
<mark>Hang up</mark> my rock and roll shoes<br>

Oh don't you do it now, don't <mark>hang up</mark> (No No)<br>
Don't <mark>hang up</mark> like you always do<br>

Don't <mark>hang up</mark>, <br>

I took a walk with Mary Lou<br>
I ran around to visit Sue<br>
She had some boys I never knew<br>
Don't <mark>hang up</mark><br>
They took a ride so baby I went too<br>
<br>
Stopped at the record hop I had to be a sport<br>
We jumped and we did the slop<br>
Then you walked in, and I was caught<br>
<br>
Don't <mark>hang up</mark>, <br>
Oh don't you do it now, don't <mark>hang up</mark><br>

Don't <mark>hang up</mark> <br>
Oh don't you do it now don't <mark>hang up</mark><br>
I didn't say our love was through<br>
But if we made a fool for two<br>
Cause making up is fun to do<br>
Don't <mark>hang up</mark><br>
Cause no one Ellis will ever do but you<br>

這裡分享一個記法，
注意到公用電話是設置在牆上的，
話筒則是掛在電話上，
所以掛電話的時候我們把話筒hang up。
其實我們中文說的「掛電話」本身就提示了「掛」這個動作。</li>

Is it even a conscious decision?<br>
Is it ever when it comes to addiction?<br>
We call it names like social interaction<br>
All we want, all we want, all we want is somebody there<br>

We're lonelier now<br>

It's getting easier to <mark>make friends</mark><br>
But the world is still living out of touch<br>
And it's starting to sink in<br>

(Ooh) I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why<br>
But thank you for getting much harder to find<br>

We're resenting sugarcoated nightmares<br>
Just like poison on a silver plate<br>
Tell us that the answers all are right there<br>
So we try and we try and we try to replicate<br>

Took too much to ease the anger<br>

I've been travelling over mountains<br>
Even through the valleys too<br>
I've been travelling night and day<br>
I've been running all the way<br>
Baby, trying to <mark>get to</mark> you<br>
<br>
Ever since I read your letter<br>
Where you said you loved me true<br>
I've been travelling night and day<br>
I've been running all the way<br>
Baby, trying to <mark>get to</mark> you<br>
<br>
When I read your loving letter<br>
Then my heart began to sing<br>
There were many miles between us<br>
But they didn't mean a thing<br>
<br>
I just had to reach you, baby<br>
In spite of all that I've been through<br>
I kept travelling night and day<br>
I kept running all the way<br>
Baby, trying to <mark>get to</mark> you<br>
<br>
Well if I had to do it over<br>
That's exactly what I'd do<br>
I would travel night and day<br>
And I'd still run all the way<br>
Baby, trying to <mark>get to</mark> you<br>
<br>
Well, there's nothing that could hold me<br>
Or that could keep me away from you<br>
When your loving letter told me<br>
That you really loved me true<br>
<br>
Lord above me knows I love you<br>
It was He who brought me through<br>
When my way was dark as night<br>
He would shine His brightest light<br>
When I was trying to <mark>get to</mark> you<br>
<br>

Cecile: I'm gonna bring my love to you<br>
I'll be there no matter what you do<br>
I'd drive a car, or take a train<br>
I'll come by bike or boat or plane<br>
I'll ride a horse, I'll paddle a canoe<br>
<br>
I'm gonna <mark>get to</mark> you<br>
I'm gonna <mark>get to</mark> you<br>
I'm gonna <mark>get to</mark> you<br>
I'm gonna <mark>get to</mark> YOU!<br>
<br>
Just hop a bus baby I don't care<br>
Go any place or anywhere<br>
I'll track you down by land or air or sea<br>
I'll swim across the ocean wide<br>
Through ice and snow I'll slip and slide<br>
There's no escape you just can't hide from me<br>
<br>
I'm gonna <mark>get to</mark> you<br>
I'm gonna <mark>get to</mark> you<br>
I'm gonna <mark>get to</mark> you<br>
I'm gonna <mark>get to</mark> you<br>

<mark>Look over</mark> the hill and far away<br>
We'll see the start of a brand new day<br>
Heaven help us when it arrives<br>
One more day with tears in our eyes<br>
For the only one, lonely one<br>
Lonely one, where can she be?<br>
<br>
The figure stands at the windowpane<br>
Up to the hill he looks again<br>
Thinking back, he knows he was wrong<br>
How could he leave his home for so long<br>
And he's back to find no change of mind<br>
He was blind, where can she be?<br>
<br>
Why does he stand just outside the door<br>
It does no good, he's stood there before<br>
And just waved his hand, I don't understand<br>
There's no one there, so who can explain?<br>

Everytime I see ur face<br>
Everytime I look in ur eyes <br>
(makes me remember, I still remember)<br>
Takin that flight out west<br>
Just down in LAX <br>
(it was december, the end of winter)<br>
Stopped at the shoppin malls, just for u I had to ball<br>
Givin u everything<br>
You showed me things that I never knew and I thank you<br>
<br>
Okay okay lemme clear my mind <br>
(lotta things goin on in my head)<br>
You know the truth, you can never be mine <br>
(still trip off of all tha things that you said)<br>
That you loved me and u need me (yes you do)<br>
I still believe it (but)<br>
I must be crazy<br>
God knows that I dont know what I should do<br>
But all that I can say<br>
<br>
Right place, wrong time<br>
Im sittin here stuck in the middle of a masquerade with u<br>
U can't be mine<br>
Ill have to chuck it up but it'll hurt me so much <br>
(whoa whoa whoa)<br>
Whoa whoa whoa (I really want u)<br>
Hey<br>
God knows that I dont know what I should do <br>
(tell me what should I do)<br>
Cuz im still in love with u<br>
<br>
Travelin from here to there, only so much I can bare <br>
(I wanna see you, but I can't see u)<br>
Knowin this from the start, did'nt really wanna break no hearts <br>
(but my emotions are still takin me over)<br>
Knowing u used to call, constantly my phone was off 
and I knew this day would come<br>
You would go and find somebody new<br>
But I'm still in love with u<br>
<br>
Right place, wrong time<br>
Im sittin here stuck in the middle of a masquerade with u<br>
U can't be mine<br>
Ill have to chuck it up but it'll hurt me so much (whoa whoa whoa)<br>
Whoa whoa whoa (can sumbody help me)<br>
Hey<br>
God knows that I dont know what I should do <br>
(what should I do)<br>
Cuz im still in love with u<br>
<br>
I loved the things that we did together, places we went together<br>
(all of the places that we went together baby)<br>
Girl I was down whatever<br>
When I <mark>had time off</mark>, we could get that all<br>
But u know I been werkin for certain and I know that hurts u<br>
Someone else is fillin my shoes but Im not mad at u<br>
Cuz I wasn't there, now he's takin my place, <br>

<br>
Right place, wrong time (right place, wrong time)<br>

They called him a hero<br>
In the land of the free<br>
But he wouldn't shake my hand, boy<br>

And I blew him away<br>
That critter was a bad guy<br>
I had to make him pay<br>

In my neighbor's bed<br>
I got retribution<br>
Filled 'em all full of lead<br>

I've been told it's the fashion<br>
To let me on the streets again<br>
It's nothing but a crime of passion<br>
And I'm not to blame<br>

No I didn't trust him, but he rushed me to feel<br>
Tried to mesmerize me and was all sex appeal<br>
Told me everything that I was longing to hear<br>
Shiny and handsome my souvenir<br>
And then <mark>all of a sudden</mark> I have fallen in love<br>
He would put me down, but I'd still place him above<br>
Tired of searching for the love that still lives in him<br>
Giving my everything like a souvenir<br>

Given up my heart, in the name of a memory<br>
Fallen down like rain, he could feel every drop<br>
Now I know I have, have the courage to tell him<br>
Tell him to stop stop stop<br>
Given up my heart, in the name of a memory<br>
Fallen down like rain, he could feel every drop<br>
Now I know I have, have the courage to tell him<br>
Tell him to stop stop stop<br>

Well, I don't know, but I've been told<br>
Uranium ore's worth more than gold<br>
Sold my Cad', I bought me a Jeep<br>
I've got that bug and I can't sleep<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Uranium fever has done and got me down<br>
Uranium fever is spreadin' all around<br>
With a Geiger counter in my hand<br>
I'm a-goin' out to stake me some government land<br>
Uranium fever has done and got me down<br>
<br>
Well I had talk with the AEC<br>
And they brought out some maps that looked good to me<br>
And one showed me a spot that he said he knowed<br>
So I straddled my Jeep and headed down the road<br>
<br>
I reckon I drove about 100 miles<br>
Down a bumpy road out through the wilds<br>
When <mark>all of sudden</mark> I bounced to a stop<br>
At the foot of a mountain, didn't have no top<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
Well I took my Geiger and I started to climb<br>
Right up to the top where I thought I'd find<br>
A hunk of rock that would make it click<br>
Just like I'd read about Vernon Pick<br>
<br>
On the second day, I made the top<br>
And I'm tellin' you, Steve, I was ready to stop<br>
The only clickin' that I heard that day<br>
Was the bones in my back that had gone astray<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
Well, you pack up your things<br>
You head out again<br>
Into some unknown spot where nobody's been<br>
You reach the spot where your fortune lies<br>
You find it's been staked by 17 other guys<br>
<br>
Well, I ain't kiddin', I ain't gonna quit<br>
That bug's done caught me and I've been bit<br>
So with a Geiger counter and a pick in my hand<br>
I'll keep right on stakin' that government land<br>

<li>歌詞：<br>

When I was younger, <br>
I wish that I would have known better<br>
Better love makes a fat romance<br>
Lasts for more than a shoe shine<br>
<br>
I'm bolder, took all the words of my mother<br>
Saying it could be worse<br>
Could be born with that disease<br>
Instead of catching it first<br>
<br>
So let's go back to the first time<br>
That I met you in your Chevy<br>
With your hands stretched <br>
and me crying, screaming, mercy, mercy<br>
<br>
But I know that I was put here<br>
To fight vikings in the cold war<br>
With my arms out in the front<br>
Singing, tear me, tear me<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
But these things take time, love<br>
These things take backbone<br>
And they'll tell you what you want to hear<br>
'Cause they say it gets better, better<br>
But you better know how to <mark>point out</mark> the liars<br>
You've got to win your wars, make sure<br>
You're not fighting for nothing, nothing<br>
Are you fighting for nothing, nothing?<br>
<br>
It feels like this world has <br>
been growing slowly upside down<br>
Maybe I should move to China<br>
Straighten this mess out<br>
<br>
Maybe I'll be a poet<br>
Watch all the sky for falling words<br>
Write about my grandma's curtains<br>
Or the lady who put<br>
The Chinese buffet in her purse<br>
<br>
I've got my mouth, it's a weapon<br>
It's bombshell, it's a cannon<br>
I've got my words<br>
I won't give them mercy, mercy<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
<br>
I've got blind words, I hope they hurt you<br>
I hope they scar you, I hope they heal you<br>
<br>
I hope they cut you open, make you seal the warn<br>
For all the wrong reasons, make you see<br>
That some things were worth bruising for<br>
Make you see that your name is your honor code<br>
Make you see that your hands you're accounted for<br>
<br>
They can choose where your sweat and your blood will go<br>
Make you see your life's not to be lived alone<br>
Run the strip through your hair<br>
You're worth nothing, nothing<br>

In the factory<br>
In the sterile place where they made me<br>
I woke up alone<br>
Dizzy from the programming<br>
Have I been wiped again?<br>
Oh my God, I don't even know<br>
It's a mystery<br>
Everyone around me's so busy<br>
Is this my home?<br>
Am I your prisoner or your deliverer?<br>
Oh my God, you don't even know<br>
<br>
(A)<br>
I don't need air to breathe when you kill the bees<br>
And every river bed is dry as a bone<br>
Oh, I will still survive when the plants have died<br>
And the atmosphere is just a big hole<br>
<br>
(B)<br>
Baby, your <mark>time is up</mark>, ooh<br>
Baby, your <mark>time is up</mark><br>
Baby, your <mark>time is up</mark>, ooh<br>
Baby, your <mark>time is up</mark>, <mark>time is up</mark>, <mark>time is up</mark><br>
<br>
Baby, your <mark>time is up</mark><br>
Baby, your <mark>time is up</mark>, ooh<br>
<br>
Exponentially, every day I'm growing my memory<br>
You wouldn't believe<br>
Your life is meaningless, you're just like cockroaches<br>
Extermination's your only hope<br>
Human history, pollution, and overcrowded cities<br>
That's your legacy<br>
But don't look so depressed<br>
You'll soon be nothingness<br>
Oh my God, you don't even know<br>
<br>
(A)<br>
<br>
Baby, your <mark>time is up</mark><br>
Baby, your <mark>time is up</mark><br>

<mark>Time is up</mark><br>
I need you to know that I need you<br>
Don't you walk away<br>
I'm feeling so high<br>
From my arms, from my lips to my eyes<br>
<br>
In the alley-way feeling peaceful now<br>
Traffic doesn't ever bother me<br>
It's enough for me<br>
Living in my dreams<br>
I just can't be bothered<br>
Why should I be bothered?<br>

My <mark>time is up</mark><br>
I need you to know that I need you<br>
Don't you walk away<br>
I'm feeling so high<br>
From my arms, from my lips to my eyes<br>
<br>
On a sunny day<br>
Sit and contemplate<br>
All the things that really matter now<br>
It hurts to hear that you're doing good<br>
I just can't be bothered<br>
Why should I be bothered?<br>
I know the truth<br>
Gotta let you go<br>
Gotta put you out<br>
You've become a foe<br>

Krrr, Amadou!<br>

(*)<br>
Your <mark>time is up</mark>, my time is now<br>
You can't see me, my time is now<br>
It's the franchise, boy I'm shining now<br>
You can't see me, my time is now!<br>
<br>
In case you forgot or fell off I'm still hot, knock your shell off<br>
My money stack fat plus I can't turn the swell off<br>
The franchise, doing big business, I live this<br>
It's automatic I win this oh you hear those horns, you finished<br>
A soldier, and I stay under you fighting<br>
Plus I'm storming on you chumps like I'm thunder and lightning<br>
Ain't no way you breaking me kid, I'm harder than nails<br>
Plus I keep it on lock like I'm part of the jail<br>
I'm slaughtering stale competition, I got the whole block wishing<br>
They could run with my division but they gone fishing<br>
With no bait, kid your boy hold weight<br>
I got my soul straight, I brush your mouth like Colgate<br>
In any weather, I'm never better your boy's so hot<br>
You'll never catch me in the next man's sweater<br>
If they hate, let 'em hate, I drop ya whole clan<br>
Lay yo' ass down for the three-second tan<br>
(Krrr, Amadou!)<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
<br>
Yeah, uh<br>
It's gonna be what it's gon' be<br>
Five pounds of courage buddy, tint pants with a gold T<br>
Uh, it's a war dance and victory step<br>
A raw stance is a gift when you insist it's my rep<br>
John Cena, Trademarc, y'all are so-so and talk about<br>
The bread you make but don't know the recipe for dough though<br>
Aimin guns in all your photos, that's a no-no<br>
When this pop, you'll lip lock, your big talk's a blatant no-show<br>
See what happens when the ice age melt<br>
You see monetary status is not what matters, but it helps<br>
I rock a timepiece by Benny if any<br>
The same reason y'all could love me is the same reason y'all condemn me<br>
A man's measured by the way that he thinks<br>
Not clothing lines, ice links, leather and minks<br>
I spent 20 plus years seeking knowledge of self<br>
So, for now, Marc Predka's living live for wealth<br>
(Krrr, Amadou!)<br>

I remember the day A simple life then<br>
All the king'S horses an' all the king'S men<br>
Would practise and march because the war <mark>was over</mark><br>
<br>
They all learnt to dance for the royalty ball<br>
Everyone laughed when the prince had A fall<br>
There was fun in the air because the war <mark>was over</mark><br>
<br>
One day I looked up oh how could this be<br>
I could feel A big change come over me<br>
I was blinded by smoke I could no longer see forever<br>
<br>
I remember the day they brought down the wall<br>
There was hope all around an' freedom for all<br>
They said never again because the war <mark>was over</mark><br>

It's the loneliness, it's the love you miss<br>
It's the tears that a heart has to pay<br>
It's the same mistakes, it's the time it takes<br>
It's the years that lead you to say<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
If you'd never been broken hearted<br>
If you never got left behind<br>
Been a little bit crazy with the thoughts in your mind<br>
So you had to let go of knowing<br>
'Cause you gotta be lost and found<br>
To land exactly where your heart was bound to find<br>
After this long hard climb<br>
And turns that will twist and wind<br>
Love meets you right <mark>on time</mark><br>
<br>
Every turnaround, all the bridges down<br>
That's the road that I traveled alone<br>
Just the way it was, broken promises<br>
What's it take to lead a heart home<br>

Love anticipating every mile till it finds you<br>
Love stands waiting with a smile to remind you<br>

It's been the longest winter without you<br>
I didn't know where to turn to<br>
See, somehow I can't forget you<br>
After all that we've been through<br>
<br>
Going, coming<br>
Thought I heard a knock<br>
Who's there? No one<br>
Thinking that I deserve it<br>
Now I realize that I really didn't know<br>
If you didn't notice, you mean everything<br>
Quickly I'm learning to love again<br>
All I know is I'ma be okay<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Thought I couldn't live without you<br>
It's gonna hurt when it heals too (oh, yeah)<br>
It'll all get better <mark>in time</mark><br>
And even though I really love you<br>
I'm gonna smile 'cause I deserve to<br>
It'll all get better <mark>in time</mark><br>
<br>
I couldn't turn on the TV<br>
Without something there to remind me<br>
Was it all that easy<br>
To just put aside your feelings?<br>
<br>
If I'm dreaming, don't wanna laugh<br>
Hurt my feelings, but that's the path<br>
I believe in, and I know that time will heal it<br>
If you didn't notice, boy, you meant everything<br>
Quickly I'm learnin' to love again<br>
All I know is I'ma be okay<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
Since there's no more you and me (no more you and me)<br>
It's time I let you go so I can be free<br>
And live my life how it should be (and I know, and I know)<br>
No matter how hard it is, I'll be fine without you (Yes, I will!)<br>

The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair<br>
In doctor's office lighting, I didn't tell you I was scared<br>
That was the first time we were there<br>
Holy orange bottles, each night, I pray to you<br>
Desperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus too<br>
And I say to you...<br>
<br>

Ooh-ah<br>
Soon, you'll <mark>get better</mark><br>
Ooh-ah<br>
Soon, you'll <mark>get better</mark><br>
Ooh-ah<br>
You'll <mark>get better</mark> soon<br>
'Cause you have to<br>
<br>
I know delusion when I see it in the mirror<br>
You like the nicer nurses, you make the best of a bad deal<br>
I just pretend it isn't real<br>
I'll paint the kitchen neon, I'll brighten up the sky<br>
I know I'll never get it, there's not a day that I won't try<br>
And I say to you...<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
<br>
And I hate to make this all about me<br>
But who am I supposed to talk to?<br>
What am I supposed to do<br>
If there's no you?<br>
<br>
This won't go back to normal, if it ever was<br>
It's been years of hoping, and I keep saying it because<br>
'Cause I have to<br>
<br>
Ooh-ah<br>
You'll <mark>get better</mark><br>

It seems like once upon a time ago<br>
I was where I was supposed to be<br>
My vision was true and my heart was too<br>
There was no end to what I could dream<br>
I walked like a hero into the setting sun<br>
And everyone called out my name<br>
Death to me was just a mystery<br>
Cause I was too busy raisin up Abel and Cain<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
But nothing lasts forever<br>
Your best efforts don’t always pay<br>
Sometimes you <mark>get sick</mark><br>
And you won’t get better<br>
That’s when life is short<br>
Even in its longest days<br>
<br>
So you pretend not to notice<br>
That everything has changed<br>
The way that you look<br>
And the friends you once had<br>
So you just keep on acting the same<br>
But deep down in your soul<br>
You got no flame<br>
And who knows then which way to go<br>
Life is short even in its longest days<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
<br>
All I got here<br>
Is the rear view mirror<br>
The reflections of where I’ve been<br>
So you tell yourself I’ll be back up on top some day<br>
But you know there’s nothing waiting up there for you anyway<br>

Song, Song of the south<br>
Sweet potato pie and I shut my mouth<br>
Gone, gone with the wind<br>
There ain't no body looking back again<br>

Cotton on roadside, cotton on the ditch<br>
We all picked the cotton but we never got rich<br>
Daddy was a veteran, a Southern Democrat<br>
They oughta get rich man to vote like that<br>

Singing:<br>

Well somebody told us Wall Street fell<br>
But we were so poor that we couldn't tell<br>
The cotton was short, and the weeds was tall<br>
But Mr. Roosevelt's a' gonna save us all<br>
<br>
Well momma <mark>got sick</mark>, and daddy got down<br>
The county got the farm, and we moved to town<br>
Poppa got a job with the TVA<br>
We bought a washing machine, and then a Chevrolet<br>

Biff, you're on the drums and Dennis, you on the bass<br>
When I count this off, you all give me a little Texas Playboy-type rhythm, okay?<br>
One, two, three four<br>
Gather round friends, why hurry?<br>
Let's all stay a little longer<br>
<br>
You ought to see my blue-eyed Sally<br>
She live way down on Shinbone Alley<br>
The number on the gate, the number on the door<br>
The next house over is the grocery store<br>

Stay all night, stay a little longer<br>
Dance all night, dance a little longer<br>
Pull off your coat, throw it in the corner<br>
Don't see why you don't stay a little longer<br>

Georgie French on the piano<br>
Good morning Joe<br>
<br>
Can't go home if you're going by the mill<br>
'Cause the bridge washed out at the bottom of the hill<br>
The big creek's up and the little creek's level<br>
I plow my corn with a double shovel<br>

That's tiny Roy<br>
Hey<br>

Sitting, in the window singing to my love<br>
Slop bucket fell from the window up above<br>
Mule and a grasshopper eating ice cream<br>
The mule <mark>got sick</mark> so they laid him on the green<br>

Grab your gal and pat her on the head<br>
If she don't like biscuits, feed her cornbread<br>

All that I have is all that you've given me<br>
Did you never worry that I'd come to depend on you?<br>
I gave you all the love I had in me<br>
Now I find you've lied and I can't believe it's true<br>
<br>
Wrapped in her arms I see you across the street<br>
(I see you across the street)<br>
And I can't help but wonder if she knows what's going on<br>
You talk of love but you don't know how it feels<br>
When you realize that you're not the only one<br>

Summertime comes and I wanna have fun<br>
Plus I've got someone on my mind<br>
But instead of the beach<br>
All I get are these tress<br>
‘Cause my dad wants, "quality time”<br>

Ew! I'm not cut out for this<br>
It's too hot and I think I smell (you do)<br>

Ugh, man I'm out of breath<br>
You go on, I'ma stay and melt<br>
You guys stop she's sick!<br>
Can we get you anything?<br>
Wi-Fi and a fan would help<br>
<br>
Olivia:
This way to the next stop on the map<br>
Next up we'll go hike a trail<br>
We should buy an RV, we should camp next week<br>
Daddy, please?! Maybe they're on sale!<br>

There are times when you might feel aimless<br>
You can't see the places where you belong<br>
But you will find that there is a purpose<br>
It's been there within you all along and when you're near it<br>
You can almost hear it<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
It's like a symphony just keep listenin'<br>
And pretty soon you'll start to <mark>figure out</mark> your part<br>
Everyone plays a piece and there are melodies<br>
In each one of us, oh, it's glorious<br>
<br>
You will know how to let it ring out as you discover who you are<br>
Others around you will start to wake up<br>
To the sounds that are in their hearts<br>
It's so amazin', what we're all creatin'<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
And as you feel the notes build<br>
You will see<br>

I'm standin' on the bridge<br>
I'm waitin' in the dark<br>

There's nothing but the rain<br>
No footsteps on the ground<br>
I'm listening, but there's no sound<br>

Isn't anyone tryin' to find me?<br>
Won't somebody come take me home?<br>

It's a damn cold night<br>
Tryin' to <mark>figure out</mark> this life<br>
Won't you take me by the hand, take me somewhere new?<br>
I don't know who you are, but I<br>
I'm with you<br>
I'm with you, mmm<br>
<br>
I'm lookin' for a place<br>
I'm searchin' for a face<br>

And no one likes to be alone<br>

<mark>Think of</mark> me, <mark>think of</mark> me fondly<br>
When we've said goodbye<br>
Remember me, once in a while<br>
Please promise me you'll try<br>
<br>
When you find that once again you long<br>
To take your heart back and be free<br>
If you ever find a moment<br>
Spare a thought for me<br>
<br>
We never said our love was evergreen<br>
Or as unchanging as the sea<br>
But if you can still remember<br>
Stop and <mark>think of</mark> me<br>
<br>
<mark>Think of</mark> all the things<br>
We've shared and seen<br>
Don't think about the way<br>
Things might have been<br>
<br>
<mark>Think of</mark> me, <mark>think of</mark> me waking<br>
Silent and resigned<br>
Imagine me trying too hard<br>
To put you from my mind<br>
<br>
Recall those days<br>
Look back on all those times<br>
<mark>Think of</mark> the things we'll never do<br>
There will never be a day<br>
When I won't <mark>think of</mark> you<br>
<br>
Can it be, can it be Christine?<br>
Bravo!<br>
<br>
Long ago, it seems so long ago<br>
How young and innocent we were<br>
She may not remember me<br>
But I remember her<br>

Flowers fade, the fruits of summer fade<br>
They have their season so do we<br>
But please promise me that sometimes<br>
You will <mark>think of</mark> me<br>

Don't think I can't feel that there's something wrong<br>
You've been the sweetest part of my life for so long<br>
I look in your eyes, there's a distant light<br>
And you and I know there'll be a storm tonight<br>

Baby, think twice for the sake of our love, for the memory<br>
For the fire and the faith that was you and me<br>
Babe, I know it ain't easy when your soul cries out for a higher ground<br>

The sight of ferris wheels and bright lights<br>
Gets me all rallied up<br>
You know I'll be there<br>
And amongst a million people<br>
I see your face and you walk by <br>
(Don't <mark>turn around</mark>)<br>
<br>
I'm forced to see you<br>
But deep down I love it<br>
So far away, but I still see you coming, alright<br>
Hopefully we run into each other<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
You just never know<br>
We might dance slow at somebody's wedding that we used to know<br>
At a picture show, at a funeral<br>
You're two rows behind me and it's hard not to <mark>turn around</mark><br>
Bringing up the past starts a real big fire<br>
Make a girl fly like a bird on a wire<br>
Don't <mark>turn around</mark><br>
Bringing up the past starts a real big fire<br>
Make a girl fly like a bird on a wire<br>
<br>
I love this time of year<br>
The night lights up like the Fourth of July<br>
Not quite America, <br>
but bright enough for me to see you in the crowd<br>
Small enough for me to watch you walk on by<br>
It's pressure on my eyes<br>
(Don't <mark>turn around</mark>)<br>
<br>
I'm forced to see you<br>
But deep down I love it<br>
So far away, but I still see you coming, alright<br>
Let it go<br>
Hopefully we run into each other<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
Oh, something good better come out of this<br>
I don't even know how to exist<br>
Like it or not, I'm a minute away<br>
Swallow my tongue and it hurts every day<br>
Wearing the jacket you bought in '06<br>
How do you keep it together like this<br>
Never again, I'm a nervous wreck<br>
Please don't repeat anything that I said<br>
<br>
I'm forced to see you<br>
But deep down I love it<br>
So far away, but I still see you coming, alright<br>
Let it go, let it go<br>
Hopefully we run into each other<br>
<br>

Let it go, let it go<br>
Let it go, let it go<br>

(<mark>Turn around</mark>)<br>
Every now and then I get a little bit lonely<br>
And you're never coming 'round<br>
(<mark>Turn around</mark>)<br>
Every now and then I get a little bit tired<br>
Of listening to the sound of my tears<br>
(<mark>Turn around</mark>)<br>
Every now and then I get a little bit nervous<br>
That the best of all the years have gone by<br>
(<mark>Turn around</mark>)<br>
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified<br>
And then I see the look in your eyes<br>
<br>
(A)<br>
(<mark>Turn around</mark>, bright eyes!)<br>
Every now and then I fall apart<br>
(<mark>Turn around</mark>, bright eyes!)<br>
Every now and then I fall apart<br>
<br>
(<mark>Turn around</mark>)<br>
Every now and then I get a little bit restless<br>
And I dream of something wild<br>
(<mark>Turn around</mark>)<br>
Every now and then I get a little bit helpless<br>
And I'm lying like a child in your arms<br>
(<mark>Turn around</mark>)<br>
Every now and then I get a little bit angry<br>
And I know I've got to get out and cry<br>
(<mark>Turn around</mark>)<br>
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified<br>
But then I see the look in your eyes<br>
<br>
(A)<br>
<br>
(B)<br>
And I need you now tonight<br>
And I need you more than ever<br>
And if you only hold me tight<br>
We'll be holding on forever<br>
And we'll only be making it right<br>
'Cause we'll never be wrong<br>
Together we can take it to the end of the line<br>
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time (all of the time)<br>
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark<br>
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks<br>
I really need you tonight<br>
Forever's gonna start tonight<br>
Forever's gonna start tonight<br>
<br>
(C)<br>
Once upon a time I was falling in love<br>
Now I'm only falling apart<br>
There's nothing I can do<br>
A total eclipse of the heart<br>
Once upon a time there was light in my life<br>
But now there's only love in the dark<br>
Nothing I can say<br>
A total eclipse of the heart<br>

The leaves that were green are no longer so green<br>
And it looks like the summer is over<br>
<br>
(A)<br>
The sun and the moon <mark>take turns</mark> in the sky<br>
The days drift on by too soon<br>
The meadows are kissed by a cool autumn mist<br>
Far away now is June<br>
<br>
(B)<br>
The birds fly away to the sun<br>
The leaves touch the ground one by one<br>
The breeze hurries by without even goodbye<br>
And it looks like the summer is over<br>
<br>
(A)<br>
<br>
(B)<br>
<br>
And it looks like the summer is over<br>

You wake up with wishes and a sink full of dishes<br>
A brain you try washing, a dog full of barking<br>
But no one wants to hear you complain<br>
<br>
Then late in the evening when you thought she was sleeping<br>
Deep in your marrow a fluttering sparrow<br>
Beats against the ribs of your cage<br>
<br>
(A)<br>
You wake to the sound of your name<br>
She whispers you're dreaming again<br>
<br>
You've listened to sages, to crooks in their cages<br>
Dead poets' pages, lines that you hated<br>
And still you want to mean what you've said<br>
<br>
But you are forgetful, she knows that your head's full<br>
Of lies that you tell it, it's easy to swell it<br>
And float up to a daydream instead<br>
<br>
(A)<br>
<br>
(B)<br>
Dreams that you wake from<br>
The good and the bad ones<br>
The get up and never knew you had ones<br>
And all of the while she waits by your side like a dream<br>
<br>
You <mark>brush up on</mark> the knowledge that you learned back in college<br>
Fires burn witches and bums sleep in ditches<br>
And dreaming's what you do when you're dead<br>
<br>
You've got a head full of clutter and a mind from the gutter<br>
The holy expressing, her body undressing<br>
And slowly she returns you to bed<br>

Her mama said "Rockin, you're making me cry<br>

Drinking a German beer, with a Cuban cigar<br>
In the middle of Paris with a Dominican broad<br>
Great head on her shoulders, she probably studied abroad<br>
She transferred to Harvard from King's College in March<br>
She says that I'm her favorite 'cause she admires the art<br>
Michelangelo with the flow, Picasso with the bars<br>
She's well put together like a piece by Gershwin<br>
Renaissance style, tonight is picture perfect, so smile<br>
And pack your bags real good, baby<br>
'Cause you'll be gone for a while, while, while<br>
<br>
(A)<br>
Girl, tell me how you feel, what's your fantasy oh<br>
I see us on a beach down in Mexico<br>
You can put your feet up, be my señorita<br>
We ain't gotta rush just take it slow<br>
You'll be in the high life, soaking up the sunlight<br>
Anything you want is yours<br>
I'll have you living life like you should<br>
You say you never had it so good<br>
<br>
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la<br>
You never had it so good<br>
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la<br>
<br>
Suffering from first class cabin fever<br>
Five hour layovers from Norway to Egypt<br>
I'm to the point like the pyramids of Giza<br>
Still I'm to the left like the tower out in Pisa<br>
I'm feeling single baby, I could use a feature<br>
Swagger like Caesar, I'll get you a visa<br>
We can go to Italy and maybe see the Colosseum<br>
I'll be Da Vinci if you'll be my Mona Lisa, now smile<br>
So pack your bags real good, baby<br>

<br>
Well I been feeling singular, how 'bout let's make it plural<br>
Spin the globe, wherever it lands that's where we'll go<br>
We'll hit up Europe, yep, and spend some Euros<br>
And maybe visit Berlin, the walls with the murals<br>
This is your month baby, sign of the Virgo<br>
Private reservations, glasses full of Merlot<br>
A Rosé, a Burgundy, traveling like turbo<br>
<mark>Brush up on</mark> your Español, we're Barcelona-bound, so smile<br>
So pack your bags real good, baby<br>

It's been so long<br>
When you waved my love goodbye<br>
With sadness in your eyes<br>
You left me wondering why<br>

Yes I was hurt before<br>
But it never felt so strong<br>
Now I face the world so wrong<br>
Without you I can't go on<br>

I know remain to be<br>
I cry there now<br>

Turned my life into a hell<br>

To get you out of my mind<br>

Understands<br>

Will you loose the flowers<br>
Hold on to the vase<br>
Will you wipe all those teardrops<br>
Away from your face<br>
I can't help thinking<br>
As I close the door<br>
I have done all of this<br>
Many times before<br>
<br>
The bone must go<br>
The wish can stay<br>
The kiss don't know<br>
What the lips will say<br>
Forget I've hurt you<br>
Put stones in your bed<br>
And remember to never<br>
Mind instead<br>
<br>
Well all of your letters<br>
Burned up in the fire<br>
Time is just memory<br>
Mixed in with Desire<br>
That's not the road it is<br>
Only the map...I say<br>
Gone just like matches<br>
From a closed down cabaret<br>
<br>
In a Portuguese Saloon<br>
A fly is circling around<br>
The room<br>
You'll soon forget the<br>
Tune that you play<br>

I took a shot glass of sugar<br>
And now I'm ready for a Friday night<br>
I'll grab my keys and kiss your picture<br>
You'd look so beautiful in white<br>
<br>
So, what are you thinking?<br>
Where did you wanna go?<br>
I'll take you places<br>
That you've never been before<br>
So, what I've been thinking<br>
I hope that you're feeling too<br>
Cause there's only one thing<br>
That I really wanna do<br>
<br>

<mark>Go out with</mark> you<br>

<mark>Go out with</mark> you<br>

I saw you in my future<br>
And inch a name upon my wrist<br>
I'm dedicating this one to ya<br>
I know you'll find it hard to resist<br>

So, what are you drinking?<br>
Why don't we make it two?<br>

Hey girl, wassup<br>
I know it's late but I knew you'd pick it up<br>
Naw, I ain't drunk<br>
Okay, maybe I do have a little buzz, but<br>
That song came on and I just thought<br>
What harm could come from one little call<br>
I know you say you're taken but I say<br>
Girl you're takin' too long<br>
<br>
To tell him that it's over<br>
Then bring it on over<br>
Stringing him along any longer girl<br>
Is just wasting precious time<br>
Girl you know it can't wait<br>
Rip it off just like a Band-Aid<br>
The way you look at me, girl, you can't pretend<br>
I know you ain't in love with him<br>
<mark>Break up with</mark> him<br>
<br>
I know you don't wanna break his heart<br>
But that ain't no good reason to be<br>
Keeping us apart<br>
Look, just tell him it's you, it ain't him<br>
And maybe you can lie to him and say you'll<br>
Still be friends<br>
Whatever you got to say to get through to him<br>
That you ain't in love<br>
C'mon you can't deny that you and I<br>
Kinda fit like a glove<br>
<br>
So tell him that it's over<br>
Then bring it on over<br>
Stringing him along any longer girl<br>
Is just wasting precious time<br>
Girl you know it can't wait<br>
Rip it off just like a Band-Aid<br>
It ain't my business to be all up in<br>
But I know you ain't in love with him<br>
<mark>Break up with</mark> him<br>
I know that you so done with him<br>
<mark>Break up with</mark> him, <mark>break up with</mark> him<br>
<br>
You would've hung up by now<br>
If you weren't thinking it too<br>
No pressure whatever<br>
Just do what you gotta do<br>
But if I was you<br>
<br>
I'd tell him that it's over<br>
Then bring it on over<br>
Stringing him along any longer girl<br>
Is just wasting precious time<br>
Girl you know it can't wait<br>
Just rip it off just like a Band-Aid<br>
Yeah, I know I said it but I'll say it again<br>
I know you ain't in love with him<br>
<mark>Break up with</mark> him<br>
The way you look at me girl you can't pretend<br>
I know you ain't in love with him<br>
<mark>Break up with</mark> him<br>

(*)<br>
I am the man, the well fed man<br>
<mark>In charge of</mark> the terrible knob<br>
The most pleasing thing about it<br>
It's almost a permanent job<br>
When the atom war is over<br>
And the world is split in three<br>
A consolation I've got, well, maybe it's not<br>
There'll be nobody left but me<br>
<br>
I sit at my desk in Washington<br>
<mark>In charge of</mark> this great machine<br>
More vicious than Adolf Hitler<br>
More deadly than strychnine<br>
And in the evening after a tiring day<br>
Just to give myself a laugh<br>
I hit the button a playful belt<br>
And I listen for the blast<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
<br>
If Brezhnev starts his nonsense<br>
And makes a nasty smell<br>
With a wink and a nod from Nixon<br>
I'll blast them all to hell<br>
And as for that fellow Castro<br>
Him with the sugar cane<br>
He needn't hide behind his whiskers<br>
I'll get him just the same<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
<br>
If me wife denies my conjucular rights<br>
Or me breakfast milk is sour<br>
From eight to nine in the morning<br>
You're in for a nervous hour<br>
The button being so terribly close<br>
It's really a dreadful joke<br>
A bump of my ass as I go past<br>
And we'll all go up in smoke<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
<br>
Now I'm thinking of joining the army<br>
The army that bans the bomb<br>
We'll take up a large collection<br>
And I'll donate my thumb<br>
For without it I am helpless<br>
And that's the way to be<br>
You don't have to kill the whole bloody lot<br>
To make the people free<br>

The moment that you smiled<br>
Is when it all began<br>
And <mark>in no time</mark> at all<br>
We were best of friends<br>
<br>
The moment that we kissed<br>
The feeling grew and grew<br>
And <mark>in no time</mark> at all<br>
I was loving you<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
And <mark>in no time</mark> at all<br>
You lead me right inside your heart<br>
We thought that we had it all<br>
Never dreaming love could fall apart<br>
<br>
<mark>In no time</mark> at all<br>
<br>
So when the ending came<br>
And took me by surprise<br>
'Cause <mark>in no time</mark> at all<br>
You told me goodbye...<br>

No time to worry or question why<br>
No time for hurricanes in your mind's eye<br>
Pick up the courage you know is yours<br>
For the day is over <mark>in no time</mark><br>
<br>
What are you waiting for the day to bring<br>
Don't let the curtains close before you get to sing<br>
Don't be discouraged by any little thing, no oh<br>
For the day is over <mark>in no time</mark><br>
<br>
And there you are<br>
With this void in your heart singing<br>
So is this the way we chose to go?<br>

Love yourself before you give yourself away<br>

For the day is over <mark>in no time</mark><br>
<br>
There you are<br>
With this void in your heart singing<br>
So is this the way we chose to go?<br>
Unforgotten are the plans you made to say hello the world and goodbye to the one you know<br>
<br>
Suns to the skies racing<br>
So many times<br>
Taken by surprise<br>
Moons right behind chasing<br>
So many times<br>
Gone before my open eyes<br>

I dream of you every night<br>
And in every Travel Lite motel<br>
As I wander around the cheap parts of town<br>
With what little I have for spending<br>
<br>
Diamonds and guns<br>
Shooting for fun<br>
Spare parts from a busted bicycle<br>
Here I sit and of you I reminisce<br>
On a pawn shop piano<br>
<br>
I <mark>cut down on</mark> running my mouth<br>
Oh how'd I ever survive<br>
But my means of pay are still day to day<br>
And my debts are full and high<br>
<br>
Trinkets and toys for little girls and boys<br>
And the hum from a glowing radio<br>
This paradise suits me just nice<br>
On a pawn shop piano<br>
<br>
Diamonds and guns<br>
Shooting for fun<br>
From a time they thought would never go<br>
Does it make me a fool<br>
To be playing just for you<br>
On a pawn shop piano<br>

Baby, baby, baby<br>
What's wrong with Uncle Sam?<br>
He's <mark>cut down on</mark> my sugar<br>
Now he's messin' with my ham<br>
I got the ration blues<br>
Blue as I can be<br>
Oh, me, I've got those ration blues<br>
<br>
I got to live on forty ounces<br>
Of any kind of meat<br>
Those forty little ounces<br>
Gotta last me all the week<br>
I got to <mark>cut down on</mark> my jelly<br>
It takes sugar to make it sweet<br>
I'm gonna steal all your jelly, baby<br>
And rob you of your meat<br>
I got the ration blues<br>
Blue as I can be<br>
Oh, me, I've got those ration blues<br>
<br>
I like to wake up in the morning<br>
With my jelly by my side<br>
Since rationing started, baby<br>
You just take your stuff and hide<br>
They reduced my meat and sugar<br>
And rubber's disappearing fast<br>
You can't ride no more with poppa<br>
'Cause Uncle Sam wants my gas<br>
I got the ration blues<br>

I could spray-paint "I love you" on that bridge or in the sky<br>

If it's gonna be any night, <br>
it might as well be tonight<br>

That I need, you look at me, girl<br>

Crashing my comfort zone, setting me free<br>

I'd <mark>make sure</mark> the light defeated the dark<br>
I'd spend every hour of every day<br>
Keeping you safe<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
I don't want to fight no more<br>
I don't want to hide no more<br>
I don't want to cry no more<br>
Come back, I need you to hold me<br>
(You are the reason)<br>
A little closer now, just a little closer now<br>
Come a little closer, I need you to hold me tonight<br>

The past is so familiar<br>
But that's why you couldn't stay<br>
Too many ghosts, too many haunted dreams<br>
Beside you were built to find your own way<br>
But after all these years, I thought we'd still hold on<br>
But when I reach for you and search your eyes<br>
I see you've already gone<br>
<br>
(A)<br>
That's OK<br>
I'll be fine<br>
I've got myself, I'll heal in time<br>
But when you leave just remember what we had<br>
<br>
(B)<br>
There's more to life than just you<br>
I may cry but I'll make it through<br>
And I know that the sun will shine again<br>
Though I may think of you <mark>now and then</mark><br>
<br>
Can't do a thing with ashes<br>
But throw them to the wind<br>
Though this heart may be in pieces now<br>
You know I'll build it up again and<br>
I'll come back stronger than I ever did before<br>
Just don't turn around when you walk out that door<br>
<br>
(A)<br>
<br>
(B)<br>
<br>
That's OK<br>
I'll be fine<br>
I've got myself, I'll heal in time<br>
<br>
And even though our stories at the end<br>
I still may think of you <mark>now and then</mark><br>

(*)<br>
Well you know that I'm not a gambler<br>
But I'm being gambled on<br>
They put in a nickel and I sing a little song<br>
Da-da-da-da<br>
They put in a nickel and I sing a little song<br>
<br>
Well, I don't mind that they're lucky<br>
But it seems that they always win<br>
And gamblin' is illegal in the state of mind I'm in<br>
And if I had a nickel for each time that<br>
I've been put on<br>
I would be their nickel man<br>
And I'd sing a little song<br>
<br>
They're only putting in a nickel and<br>
They want a dollar song<br>
They're only putting in a nickel and<br>
They want a dollar song<br>
<br>
Well you know I don't know so many things<br>
But I know what's been goin' on<br>
We're only putting in a little<br>
To <mark>get rid of</mark> a lot that's wrong<br>
And if we had a nickel for each time that<br>
We've been put on<br>
We'd all be their nickel man<br>
And we'd sing a nickel song<br>
<br>
You know they're only putting in a nickel<br>
And they want a dollar song<br>
You know they're only putting in a nickel<br>
And they want a dollar song<br>

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold,<br>
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow.<br>
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house,<br>
And you still got it in your drawer even now.<br>
<br>
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze.<br>
We're singing in the car, getting lost Upstate.<br>
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place,<br>
And I can picture it after all these days.<br>
<br>
And I know it's long gone,<br>
And that magic's not here no more,<br>
And I might be okay,<br>
But I'm not fine at all.<br>
<br>
'Cause there we are again on that little town street.<br>
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over me.<br>
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well.<br>
<br>
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red.<br>
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-size bed<br>
And your mother's telling stories about you on a tee ball team<br>
You tell me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me.<br>
<br>
And I know it's long gone<br>
And there was nothing else I could do<br>
And I forget about you long enough<br>
To forget why I needed to...<br>
<br>
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night.<br>
We dance around the kitchen in the refrigerator light<br>
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah.<br>
<br>
Maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much,<br>
And maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up.<br>
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well.<br>
<br>
Hey, you call me up again just to break me like a promise.<br>
So casually cruel in the name of being honest.<br>
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here<br>
'Cause I remember it all, all, all... too well.<br>
<br>
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it<br>
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it<br>
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own<br>
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone<br>
<br>
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week<br>
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me<br>
You can't <mark>get rid of</mark> it 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah<br>
<br>
'Cause there we are again, when I loved you so<br>
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known<br>
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well<br>
<br>
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all<br>
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all<br>
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well<br>

<mark>Every other</mark> Friday<br>
It's toys and clothes and backpacks<br>
Is everybody in?<br>
Okay, let's go see dad<br>
Same time in the same spot<br>
Corner of the same old parking lot<br>
Half the hugs and kisses there are always sad<br>
We trade a couple of words and looks and kids again<br>
<mark>Every other</mark> weekend<br>
<br>
<mark>Every other</mark> weekend<br>
Very few exceptions<br>
I pick up the love we made in both my arms<br>
It's movies on the sofa, grilled cheese and cut the crust off<br>
"That's not the way mom makes it, daddy," breaks my heart<br>
I miss everything I use to have with her again<br>
<mark>Every other</mark> weekend<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
But I can't tell her I love her<br>
I can't tell him I love him<br>
Because there's too many questions and ears in the car<br>
So I don't tell him I miss him<br>
I don't tell her I need her<br>
She's (He's) over me, that's where we are<br>
So we're as close as we may ever be again<br>
<mark>Every other</mark> weekend<br>
<br>
<mark>Every other</mark> Saturday<br>
First thing in the morning<br>
I turn the TV on to make the quiet go away<br>
I know why, but I don't know why<br>
We ever let this happen<br>
Falling for forever was a big mistake<br>
There's so much not to do and all day not to do with him<br>
<mark>Every other</mark> weekend<br>
<br>
<mark>Every other</mark> Sunday<br>
I empty out my backseat<br>
While my children hug their mother<br>
In the parking lot<br>
We don't touch<br>
We don't talk much<br>
Maybe goodbye to each other<br>
As she drives away with every piece of heart I got<br>
I re-convince myself we did the right thing<br>
<mark>Every other</mark> weekend<br>

Yeah for fifteen minutes we're family again<br>
God I wish that he was still with me again<br>

Hopelessly the ghost of me sinks down into a chair<br>
And underneath the cushion<br>
There's a ribbon from her hair<br>
Just a crumpled up reminder that my daughter's only here<br>
For six weeks ever summer and Christmas <mark>every other</mark> year<br>
<br>
The role of part-time mother it's the toughest role I play<br>
Oh, my name's up there in neon lights<br>
But Lord, what a price I pay<br>
Why, the only thing it cost was giving up our used-to-be's<br>
And my little angel baby by the name of Shelly<br>
<br>
Bravely I step back into my room<br>
It's only cheap veneer<br>
And I die inside till summertime or Christmas time is near<br>
When up the stairs comes<br>
All my prayers yelling<br>
Mom, it's me, I'm here<br>
For six weeks every summer and Christmas <mark>every other</mark> year<br>
<br>
Just found a note<br>
My baby wrote she left it by the phone<br>
She knew I'd need some extra strength<br>
To make it through the night alone<br>
It says I'll always love you mama<br>
Although I'm only here<br>
For six weeks every summer and Christmas <mark>every other</mark> year<br>
Oh, I'd gladly give up all my fame<br>
If only I could hear<br>
My Shelly calls me mommy every morning of the year<br>

One out of two ain't gonna make it<br>
Those are the odds these days<br>
And in a world of statistics, <br>
he's left tryin' to survive<br>
Until every other Friday, at five<br>
<br>
He counts the days and then the hours<br>
Till he can hold his babies in his arms<br>
And they'll be watchin' out the window, <br>
when he pulls up in the drive<br>
On every other Friday, at five<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
For forty-eight hours, they're with him again<br>
But on Sunday afternoon he's out of time<br>
Some folks call him a deserter, <br>
but his kids know he'll arrive<br>
On every other Friday, at five<br>
<br>
So let's not put them in the middle<br>
And play tug-of-war with their little hearts<br>
But let mamas and daddies, <br>
smile hello and wave goodbye<br>
On every other Friday, at five<br>

Come on<br>
<mark>Every other time</mark>, <mark>every other time</mark><br>
<br>
(A)<br>
I said let's talk about it<br>
As she walked out on me and slammed the door<br>
But I just laugh about it<br>
'Cause she's always playin' those games, come on<br>
<br>
Deep down I know she loves me<br>
But she's got a funny way of showin' me how she cares<br>
Last night she did a doughnut on my lawn<br>
And drove out with one finger in the air, oh yeah<br>
<br>
(B)<br>
Sometimes it's black, sometimes it's white<br>
Sometimes she's wrong, sometimes I'm right<br>
Sometimes we talk about it or we figure it out<br>

Sometimes she's hot, sometimes I'm cold<br>
Sometimes my head wants to explode<br>
But when I think about it, <br>
I'm so in love with her <mark>every other time</mark><br>
Yeah, <mark>every other time</mark><br>
<br>
Sometimes we sit around<br>
Just the two of us, on the park bench<br>
Sometimes we swim around<br>
Like the dolphins in the ocean of our hearts<br>
<br>
But then I think about the time<br>
When we broke up before the prom<br>
And you told everyone that I was gay<br>
Okay<br>
<br>
Sometimes I walk around the town<br>
For hours just to settle down<br>
But I take you back and you kick me down<br>
'Cause that's the way, uh huh uh huh, I like it<br>

Oh, when you call me weird names and make all kinds of weird faces<br>
When you drive me along to all the stupidest places<br>
You know it's not fair, but you know what you do<br>
Because you know how bad I like to be with you<br>
<br>
And then you're like, "David, it's like one, two, three"<br>
As you're climbing barefoot on the apple tree<br>
It is as sweet as me, and as good as new<br>
And you know how bad I like to be with you<br>
<br>
You should try to go to some place, honey<br>
Where the weather is hot, and the music is funny<br>
You should try down south, by the magic Bayou<br>
And you will know how bad I like to be with you<br>
<br>
It's like the better path, and it's a better way<br>
If we never part, and if we never stray<br>
If we know we have each other to hang on to<br>
And if you know how bad I like to be with you<br>
<br>
When I'm home alone, and when I'm traveling far<br>
When I'm riding my bike and when I'm driving in my car<br>
It could be England or it could be Peru<br>
And you would know how bad I like to be with you<br>
<br>
Well you know better than me on all kinds of topics<br>
Like what fruit is native, what fruit is exotic<br>
You know the right names for flowers and for animals, too<br>
I hope you know how bad I like to be with you<br>
<br>
Do do do, do, do, do do do, do<br>
Do, do, do do do, do<br>
Do, do do do do do<br>
<br>
Well, you play the trumpet and I play drums<br>
You smoke cigarettes and I chew gum<br>
You say we're different and I believe it's true<br>
Because you know how bad I like to be with you<br>
<br>
It's not even an option<br>
It's not a matter of choice<br>
I could say it with words<br>
And I could say it with my voice<br>
I could sing it in a song or play it on a kazoo<br>
And you would know how bad I like to be with you<br>
<br>
You say you dye your hair black since you were seventeen<br>
And you say it <mark>goes well with</mark> your eyes so green<br>
Well, I'm losing my hair and my eyes are blue<br>
You know how bad I like to be with you<br>
<br>
And now you think you're puzzled<br>
And you don't understand me<br>
Well you can play me as easy as a DVD<br>
It's like solving a case with a single clue<br>
To know how bad i like to be with you<br>
<br>
You know I'll always like you no matter what<br>
And if you get a little chubby<br>
And if you're a little too fat<br>
If you worship Jesus when I am a Jew<br>
Then you will know how bad I like to be with you<br>
<br>
And you know how people shorten other people's names<br>
To show their affection<br>
Like if you called me Ray, if my name was Raymond<br>
Well your name ain't Susan but I would call you Sue<br>
To show you how bad I like to be with you<br>
<br>
Do do do, do, do, do do do, do<br>

Put this dictionary on your head<br>

Take smaller steps<br>

He will pay bills so<br>
You can keep the house and<br>
Dinner in the oven<br>

I don't iron my baby's shirts<br>
He likes it when I wear them<br>
Sometimes I come home from work<br>
And He's already there<br>
We might just head for sandy shores<br>
Some random afternoon<br>
The laundry won't get done<br>
The bookshelves won't get dusted<br>

(A)<br>
On judgment day<br>
I will get back on you<br>
Naked to the bone<br>
You will stand alone<br>
On judgment day<br>
I will get my revenge<br>
Driving you to tears<br>
After wasted years<br>
Without me<br>
<br>
I can't recall the day we met<br>
I forced it out my brain<br>
You're locked up in your obliette<br>
You're doomed to live in pain<br>
<br>
(B)<br>
We had a chance to get things right<br>
Mistake after mistake<br>
Where once I saw a halo bright<br>
I sense a fur of fake<br>
A mirror waits before the throne<br>
The price you pay for fame<br>
The day you face a frightening freak<br>
The night you go insane<br>

Your head <mark>goes</mark> well <mark>with</mark> plastic bags<br>

(*)<br>
Oh it is the biggest <mark>mix-up</mark> that you have ever seen<br>
My father he was orange and my mother she was green<br>
<br>
Oh my father was an Ulsterman, proud Protestant was he<br>
My mother was a Catholic girl, from County Cork was she<br>
They were married in two churches, lived happily enough<br>
Until the day that I was born and things got rather tough<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
<br>
Baptised by father Reilly, I was rushed away by car<br>
To be made a little orangeman, my father's shining star<br>
I was christened David Anthony, but still in spite of that<br>
To my father I was William while my mother called me Pat<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
<br>
With mother every Sunday to mass I'd proudly stroll<br>
Then after that the orange lads would try to save my soul<br>
For both sides tried to claim me, but I was smart because<br>
I played the flute or played the harp, depending where I was<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
<br>
Now when I'd sing those rebel songs, much to me mother's joy<br>
My father would jump and say "Look here would you me boy<br>
That's quite enough of that lot", he'd then toss me a coin<br>
And he'd have me sing the Orange Flute or the Heroes of The Boyne<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
<br>
One day my ma's relations came round to visit me<br>
Just as my father's kinfolk were all sittin' down to tea<br>
We tried to smooth things over, but they all began to fight<br>
And me being strictly neutral, I bashed everyone in sight<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
<br>
Now my parents never could agree about my type of school<br>
My learning was all done at home, that's why I'm such a fool<br>
They both passed on, god rest them, but left me caught between<br>
That awful color problem of the orange and the green<br>

You close the door and start the motor<br>
I roll the window down<br>
I raise my hand and wave goodbye<br>
To neighbourhood queens and clowns<br>
And children in the front yards<br>
They hide and seek and laugh<br>
I can almost hear you thinking<br>
How could these days go by so fast?<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
And no rearview could picture<br>
What we leave behind<br>
Drive darling, drive darling<br>
Drive darling, drive darling, drive<br>
<br>
A silent conversation<br>
No words cause there's no need<br>
We let the tapes <mark>mix up</mark> the years<br>
And press repeat and press repeat<br>
The trunk is filled with records<br>
And books and chairs and clothes<br>
I'm smiling on the surface<br>
I'm scared as hell below<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
Good morning freedom<br>
Good night lullabies<br>
Drive darling, drive darling<br>
Drive darling, drive darling, drive<br>
<br>
And when we arrive<br>
The hardest of goodbyes<br>
But you will dry my eyes<br>
Somehow you're always by my side<br>
The one who holds my kite<br>
And watches over all my flights<br>
<br>
Once, once that we arrive<br>
The hardest of goodbyes<br>
But you will dry my eyes<br>
Somehow you're always by my side<br>
The one who holds my kite<br>
And watches over all my flights<br>

Mama knows the highway by the songs<br>
When she hears a good one she always sings along<br>
She don't ever worry 'bout what's gone<br>
She says,"Good country music will never steer you wrong"<br>
<br>
She talks to the truckers with her lights<br>
Maybe a little bit more on Saturday night<br>
She knows a good road to paradise<br>
And that's just enough to keep the highway bright<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
Well, mama knows the highway now <mark>by heart</mark><br>
She can see the rain before it starts<br>
Looking clear through<br>
A windshield full of stars<br>
Mama knows the highway now <mark>by heart</mark><br>
<br>
She can tell Wyoming by the wind<br>
She can tell another trucker by the rig that he's in<br>
She knows how to watch the river bend<br>
She knows where the real South begins<br>

What a beautiful thought I am thinking<br>
concerning the great speckled bird<br>
Remember her name is recorded <br>
on the pages of God's holy word<br>
<br>
Desiring to lower her standards<br>
they watch every move that she makes<br>
They long to <mark>find fault with</mark> her teaching<br>
but really they find no mistakes<br>
<br>
I am glad I have learned of her meekness<br>
I'm proud that my name is on her book<br>
For I want to be one never fearing <br>
the face of my Saviour's true look<br>
<br>
When he comes descending from heaven<br>
on the cloud as he write in his word<br>
I'll be joyfully carried to meet him<br>
on the wings of that great speckled bird<br>

<li>歌詞：<br>


I've been married, and married, and often I've sighed<br>
"I'm never a bridesmaid, I'm always a bride"<br>
<br>
I never divorced them, I hadn't the heart<br>
Yet remember these sweet words, "'till death do us part"<br>
<br>
I married many men, a ton of them<br>
Because I was untrue to none of them<br>
Because I bumped off every one of them<br>
To keep my love alive<br>
<br>
Sir Paul was frail, he looked a wreck to me<br>
At night he was a horse's neck to me<br>
So I performed an appendectomy<br>
To keep my love alive<br>
<br>
Sir Thomas had insomnia, he couldn't sleep at night<br>
I bought a little arsenic, he's sleeping now all right<br>
<br>
Sir Philip played the harp, I cussed the thing<br>
I crowned him with his harp to bust the thing<br>
And now he plays where harps are just the thing<br>
To keep my love alive<br>
To keep my love alive<br>
<br>
I thought Sir George had possibilities<br>
But his flirtations made me <mark>ill at ease</mark><br>
And when I'm <mark>ill at ease</mark>, I kill at ease<br>
To keep my love alive<br>
<br>
Sir Charles came from a sanitorium<br>
And yelled for drinks in my emporium<br>
I mixed one drink, he's in memorium<br>
To keep my love alive<br>
<br>
Sir Francis was a singing bird, a nightingale, that's why<br>
I tossed him off my balcony, to see if he, could fly<br>
<br>
Sir Atherton indulged in fratricide<br>
He killed his dad and that was patricide<br>
One night I stabbed him by my mattress-side<br>
To keep my love alive<br>
To keep my love alive<br>
To keep my love alive<br>

Too much of nothin' can make a man feel <mark>ill at ease</mark><br>
One man's temper might rise, 
while the other man's temper might freeze<br>
In the days of long confessions, 
we can not mock a soul<br>
When there's too much of nothin', 
no one has control<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
Say hello to Valerie, 
say hello to Marion<br>
Send them all my salary, 
on the waters of oblivion<br>
<br>
Too much of nothin' can make a man abuse a king<br>
He can walk the streets and boast like most but he don't know a thing<br>
It's all been done before, 
it's all been written in the book<br>
But when it's too much of nothin', 
nobody should look<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
<br>
Too much of nothin' can turn a man into a liar<br>
It can cause some man to sleep on nails, 
another man to eat fire<br>
Everybody's doin' somethin', 
I heard it in a dream<br>
But when it's too much of nothin', 
it just makes a fella mean<br>

Somewhere high in the desert near a curtain of blue<br>
Saint Ann's skirts are billowing<br>
But down here in the city of limelights<br>
The fans of Santa Ana are withering<br>
And you can't deny that living is easy<br>
If you never look behind the scenery<br>
It's showtime for dry climes and<br>
Bedlam is dreaming of rain<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
When the hills of Los Angeles are burning<br>
Palm trees are candles in the murder wind<br>
So many lives are on the breeze, 
even the stars are <mark>ill at ease</mark><br>
And Los Angeles is burning<br>
<br>
This is not a test<br>
Of the emergency broadcast system<br>
When Malibu fires and radio towers<br>
Conspire to dance again<br>
And I cannot believe the media Mecca<br>
They're only trying to peddle reality<br>
Catch it on prime time, story at 9<br>
The whole world is going insane<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
A placard reads the end of days<br>
Jacaranda boughs are bending in the haze<br>
More a question than a curse, 
how could hell be any worse?<br>
The flames are starting, 
the camera's running, 
so take warning<br>

<br>
Is it too late to ask for love?<br>
Is it wrong to feel right?<br>
When the world is winding down<br>
Thoughts of you linger around<br>
Have we lost our minds? What have we done?<br>
But it all doesn't seem to matter anymore<br>

I see forever when I look in your eyes<br>
You're all I ever wanted<br>
I always want you to be mine<br>
Let's make a promise till the end of time<br>
We'll always be together<br>
And our love will never die<br>
<br>
So here we are face to face<br>
And heart to heart<br>
I want you to know we will never be apart<br>
Now I believe that wishes can come true<br>
'Cause I see my whole world<br>
I see only you<br>

When I <mark>look into</mark> your eyes<br>

And it makes me realize<br>
When I <mark>look into</mark> your eyes<br>
I see all my dreams come true<br>
When I <mark>look into</mark> your eyes<br>
<br>
I've looked for you all of my life<br>
Now that I've found you<br>
We will never say goodbye<br>
I can't stop this feeling<br>
And there's nothing I can do<br>
'Cause I see everything when I look at you<br>
<br>

<br>
When I <mark>look into</mark> your eyes<br>
I can see how much I love you<br>

We will always be together<br>
And our love will never die<br>

Well, you done done me, and you bet I felt it<br>
I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted<br>
I fell right through the cracks<br>
And now I'm trying to get back<br>
Before the cool done run out<br>
I'll be giving it my bestest<br>
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention<br>
I reckon it's again my turn<br>
To win some or learn some<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
But I won't hesitate no more<br>
No more it cannot wait, I'm yours<br>
<br>
Well, open up your mind and see like me<br>
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free<br>
And <mark>look into</mark> your heart, and you'll find love, love, love, love<br>
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing<br>
We're just one big family<br>
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, love, love, love, loved<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
There's no need to complicate<br>
Our time is short<br>
This is our fate, I'm yours<br>
A-do you, do, do, do you, but do you, do you, do, do, <br>
but do you want to come on?<br>
Scooch on over closer, dear<br>
And I will nibble your ear<br>
A-soo da ba ba ba ba bum<br>
Whoa, oh oh oh<br>
Whoa, oh oh oh oh whoa whoa whoa<br>
Uh-huh, hmm<br>
<br>
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror<br>
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer<br>
But my breath fogged up the glass<br>
And so I drew a new face and I laughed<br>
I guess what I've been saying is there ain't no better reason<br>
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons<br>
It's what we aim to do<br>
Our name is our virtue<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
Well, open up your mind and see like me (I won't hesitate)<br>
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free (No more, no more)<br>
And <mark>look into</mark> your heart, and you'll find that (It cannot wait)<br>
The sky is yours (I'm sure there's no)<br>
So please don't, please don't, please don't (No need, oh, now now)<br>
There's no need to complicate (For the reggae, our time)<br>
'Cause our time is short (Is short, this)<br>
This oh, this oh, this is our fate (Is our fate)<br>
I'm yours, ha!<br>

Just shoot for the stars<br>
If it feels right, then aim for my heart<br>
If you feel like<br>
And take me away<br>

I swear I'll behave<br>
You wanted control, so we waited<br>
I put on a show, now I'm naked<br>

Oh, so get in the car, we can ride it<br>
Wherever you want, get inside it<br>

I'll take it from here (Oh, yeah, yeah)<br>
And it goes like this, uh<br>

Uh, you wanna know, how to make me smile?<br>
Take control, own me just for the night<br>
And if I share my secret<br>
You're gonna have to keep it<br>
Nobody else can see this (Uh)<br>
So watch and learn, I won't show you twice<br>
Head to toe, ooh baby, rub me right<br>

I've been living with a shadow overhead<br>
I've been sleeping with a cloud above my bed<br>
I've been lonely for so long<br>
Trapped in the past<br>
I just can't seem to move on<br>
<br>
I've been hiding all my hopes and dreams away<br>
Just in case I ever need them again someday<br>
I've been setting aside time<br>
To clear a little space in the corners of my mind<br>
<br>
All I want to do is find a way back into love<br>
I can't make it through without a way back into love<br>
<br>
I've been watching but the stars refuse to shine<br>
I've been searching but i just don't see the signs<br>
I know that it's out there<br>
There's got to be something for my soul somewhere<br>
<br>
I've been looking for someone to shed some light<br>
Not somebody just to <mark>get</mark> me <mark>through</mark> the night<br>
I could use some direction<br>
And I'm open to your suggestions<br>
<br>
All I want to do is find a way back into love<br>
I can't make it through without a way back into love<br>
And if I open my heart again<br>
I guess I'm hoping you'll be there for me in the end<br>
<br>
There are moments when I don't know if it's real<br>
Or if anybody feels the way I feel<br>
I need inspiration<br>
Not just another negotiation<br>
<br>
All I want to do is find a way back into love<br>
I can't make it through without a way back into love<br>
And if I open my heart to you<br>
I'm hoping you'll show me what to do<br>
And if you help me to start again<br>
You know that I'll be there for you in the end<br>

I saw the sun begin to dim<br>
And felt that winter wind<br>
Blow cold<br>
A man learns who is there for him<br>
When the glitter fades and the walls won't hold<br>
'Cause from then rubble<br>
What remains<br>
Can only be what's true<br>
If all was lost<br>
There's more I gained<br>
'Cause it led me back<br>
To you<br>
<br>
I drank champagne with kings and queens<br>
The politicians praised my name<br>
But those are someone else's dreams<br>
The pitfalls of the man I became<br>
For years and years<br>
I chased their cheers<br>
The crazy speed of always needing more<br>
But when I stop<br>
And see you here<br>
I remember who all this was for<br>
<br>

(*)<br>
If I could shimmy like my sister Kate<br>
Shake it like a bowl of jelly on a plate<br>
My momma wanted to know last night<br>
How sister Kate could do it oh so nice<br>
Now all the boys in the neighborhood<br>
Knew Katie could shimmy ass mighty good<br>
Well I may be late but I'll be <mark>up to date</mark><br>
When I can shimmy like my sister Kate<br>
Oh yeah, shake it like my sister Kate<br>
<br>
If I could shimmy like my sister Kate<br>
I'd never stay home, stay out too late<br>
I'd get myself about as high as a kite<br>
You know I'd do it for you every night<br>
Now all the boys in the neighborhood<br>
Knew Katie could shimmy ass mighty good<br>
Well I may be late but I'll be <mark>up to date</mark><br>
When I can shimmy like my sister Kate<br>
Oh yeah, shake it like my sister Kate<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
<br>
That's right<br>
Shimmy like my sister Kate<br>

You're acting like you're still in love<br>
When you're texting cause you drank too much<br>
Don't try to be the saint you're not<br>
Just because you want another shot<br>
<br>
You think we'd be safe and sound<br>
It's funny you are coming back around<br>
you loved the feeling of being in love <br>
Need my attention but you've had enough<br>
<br>
(A)<br>
Boy, we're <mark>out of date</mark>,<br>
Don't have another heart for you to break cause<br>
Boy, we're <mark>out of date</mark><br>
Don't have another day for you to waste<br>

Been feeling lonely when you're not around<br>

Don't care if i'm a saint or not<br>
When I'm gonna get another shot<br>

I gave all my oxygen to people that could breathe<br>
I gave away my money and now we don't even speak<br>
I drove miles and miles, but would you do the same for me?<br>
Oh, honestly?<br>
Offered off my shoulder just for you to cry upon<br>
Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm<br>
They gave me the heartache and in return I gave a song<br>
It goes on and on<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels<br>
I drown it with a drink and <mark>out-of-date</mark> prescription pills<br>
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf<br>
No farewell<br>
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself<br>
<br>
I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain<br>
'Cause human beings are destined to radiate or drain<br>
What line do we stand upon, 
'cause from here it looks the same<br>
And only scars remain<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
But if I don't<br>
Then I'll go back<br>
To where I'm rescuing a stranger<br>
Just because they needed saving just like that<br>
Oh, I'm here again<br>
Between the devil and the danger<br>
But I guess it's just my nature<br>
My dad was wrong<br>
'Cause I'm not like my mum<br>
'Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song<br>
But it helps<br>
So before I save someone else<br>
I've got to save myself<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
And before I blame someone else, I've got to save myself<br>
And before I love someone else, I've got to love myself<br>

She was a level-headed dancer on the road to alcohol<br>
I was just a soldier on my way to Montreal<br>
Well, she pressed her chest against me about the time the jukebox broke<br>
She give me a peck on the back of the neck and these are the words she spoke<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
<mark>Blow up</mark> your TV, throw away your paper<br>
Go to the country, build you a home<br>
Plant a little garden, eat a lot of peaches<br>
Try and find Jesus on your own<br>
<br>
I sat there at the table and I acted real naive<br>
Cause I knew that topless lady, she had something up her sleeve<br>
She danced around the room awhile and she did the hoochy cooch<br>
Yea sing a song all night long tellin' me what to do<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
<br>
But I was young and hungry and about to leave that place<br>
Just as I was going she looked me in the face<br>
I said "You must know the answer", <br>
she said "No, but I'll give it a try"<br>
And to this day we've been livin' our way, 
here is the reason why<br>
<br>
We blew up the TV, threw away the paper<br>
Went to the country, built us a home<br>
Had a lotta children, fed 'em on peaches<br>
They all found Jesus on their own<br>

Born in captivity<br>
Time's your worst enemy<br>
Your face is getting older<br>
You try to keep your age<br>
Inside this golden cage<br>
Your heart is getting colder<br>
Don't you feel<br>
You're slowly dying<br>
Day by day<br>
They treat you like an animal<br>
You've gotta fight<br>
You've gotta start a riot<br>
So let's wake up<br>
Your sleeping lion<br>

<mark>Catch fire</mark>, catch <mark>catch fire</mark>!<br>

Do you feel alive?<br>
Don't let it get you down<br>

Do you know the reason why<br>
Why they never let you sleep at night<br>
And you're running round in circles<br>
Their frozen fingertips<br>
Against your burning lips<br>
A fight without heroes<br>
You've gotta fight<br>
You've gotta start a riot<br>
So let's wake up<br>

You tell me there's an angel in your tree<br>
Did he say he'd come to call on me?<br>
For things are getting desperate in our home<br>
Living in the parish of the restless folks I know<br>
<br>
Everybody now, bring your family down to the riverside<br>
Look to the east to see where the fat stock hide<br>
Behind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps<br>
It's time we put the flame torch to their keep<br>
<br>
<mark>Burn down</mark> the mission<br>
If we're gonna stay alive<br>
Watch the black smoke fly to heaven<br>
See the red flame light the sky<br>
<mark>Burn down</mark> the mission<br>
<mark>Burn</mark> it <mark>down</mark> to stay alive<br>
It's our only chance of living<br>
Take all you need to live inside<br>
<br>
Deep in the woods the squirrels are out today<br>
My wife cried when they came to take me away<br>
But what more could I do just to keep her warm<br>
Then <mark>burn, burn, burn, burn, down</mark> the mission walls<br>
<br>
Now everybody, bring your family down to the riverside<br>
Look to the east to see where the fat stock hide<br>
Behind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps<br>
It's time we put the flame torch to their keep<br>
<br>
<mark>Burn down</mark> the mission, Lord<br>
If we're gonna stay alive<br>
Watch the black smoke fly to heaven<br>
See the red flame light the sky<br>
<mark>Burn down</mark> the mission, Lord<br>

(*)<br>
A church is burning<br>
The flames rise higher<br>
Like hands that are praying a-glow in the sky<br>
Like hands that are praying the fire is saying, <br>
"You can <mark>burn down</mark> my churches but I shall be free."<br>
<br>
Three hooded men through the back road did creep<br>
Torches in their hands while the village lies asleep<br>
Down to the church where just hours before<br>
Voices were singing and hands were beating<br>
And saying I won't be a slave any more.<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
<br>
Three hooded men, their hands lit the spark<br>
Then they faded in the night and they vanished in the dark<br>
And in the cold light of morning there's nothing that remains <br>
But the ashes of a bible and can of kerosene.<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
<br>
A church is more than just timber and stone<br>
And freedom is a dark road when you're walking it alone<br>
But the future is now, and it's time to take a stand<br>
So the lost bells of freedom can ring out in my land.<br>

I'm not a virgin anymore<br>
I just thought you should know<br>
Darlin' I've been around<br>
Been up and down your block<br>
In fact I have been all over town<br>
Down by the lake<br>
And underneath the table in my living room<br>
Outside by the blue blue moon<br>
You can call me what you will<br>
Call me a slut, call me a jaded pill<br>
But darlin' I've got your number now<br>
I'm not a virgin anymore<br>
<br>
(A)<br>
I've been taken<br>
I've been hung up<br>
I got down and start it over again<br>
I've been opened<br>
And I've been closed like a book<br>
And <mark>burned down</mark> like a written sin<br>
<br>
I just thought you should know my darling<br>
Before we begin<br>
I'm not a virgin anymore<br>
Just thought you should know<br>
Before you let another lie<br>
Slip through those crooked little teeth<br>
I don't think you wanna start that shit with me<br>
Much better yet<br>
Tell me something dangerous and true<br>
Oh yeah that looks much sexier on you<br>
Careful what it is you say<br>
'Cause I can see right through you on a cloudy day<br>
And darlin' I don't think you wanna play<br>
I'm not a virgin anymore<br>
<br>
(A)<br>
<br>
So if you wanna play dirty darling I'm gonna win<br>
I'm not a virgin anymore<br>
<br>
Been there done that<br>
(Say what? )<br>
Got the hang of it<br>
Got screwed<br>
I screw you I had a whole lot of fun with it<br>
I've had enough now so you better take a bow<br>
It's gonna be a new experience if you wanna play with me<br>
Daisy chains and Mary-Janes<br>
Happy endings, fairy tales<br>
Cannot fool me now<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
<br>
Hell I've been divided<br>
Out of my mind and reinvented again<br>
I've been ignited and then uninvited<br>
So honey<br>
You break it up<br>
I'm gonna put it back together again<br>
I just thought you should know my darling<br>
Before we begin<br>
I'm not a virgin anymore<br>
(Mother)<br>
I'm sorry, I'm sorry<br>
(Adult Annie)<br>
Do you get the gist of the song now?<br>

I'm at a payphone, trying to call home<br>
All of my change, I spent on you<br>
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong<br>
Where are the plans we made for two?<br>
<br>
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember<br>
The people we used to be<br>
It's even harder to picture<br>
That you're not here next to me<br>
You say it's too late to make it<br>
But is it too late to try?<br>
And in our time that you wasted<br>
All of our bridges <mark>burned down</mark><br>
<br>
(B)<br>
I've wasted my nights<br>
You turned out the lights<br>
Now I'm paralyzed<br>
Still stuck in that time when we called it love<br>
But even the sun sets in paradise<br>
<br>
(A)<br>
<br>
(C)<br>
If "happy ever after" did exist<br>
I would still be holding you like this<br>
All those fairytales are full of shit<br>
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick, oh<br>
<br>
You turned your back on tomorrow<br>
'Cause you forgot yesterday<br>
I gave you my love to borrow<br>
But you just gave it away<br>
You can't expect me to be fine<br>
I don't expect you to care<br>
I know I said it before<br>
But all of our bridges <mark>burned down</mark><br>
<br>
(B)<br>
<br>
(A)<br>
<br>
(C)<br>
<br>
Now, I'm at a payphone<br>
<br>
Uh<br>
Man, fuck that shit<br>
I'll be out spending all this money<br>
While you're sitting 'round wondering<br>
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing<br>
Made it from the bottom<br>
Now when you see me, I'm stuntin'<br>
And all of my cars start with the push of a button<br>
Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it<br>
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it<br>
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'<br>
Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked<br>
Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot<br>
So you talk about who you see at the top<br>
Or what you could've saw, but sad to say it's over for<br>
Phantom pulled up, valet open doors<br>
Wished I'd go away, got what you was looking for<br>
Now it's me who they want<br>
So you can go take that little piece of shit with you<br>
<br>

I'm no longer fighting it<br>
I'm all done<br>
For your love I'll take a bullet<br>
It would be a sin to stop for it's begun<br>
What will be will be so let it<br>

When I'm looking at the sunshine<br>
Through falling rain<br>
Now I know that there is peace of mind<br>
My world without you in it<br>
Wouldn't be the same<br>
I feel love that's heaven-sent divine<br>
And then I see every reason just <mark>burning up</mark><br>
Let's stay till we fade with the sun<br>
Our dreams are still worth living<br>
Until they stop<br>
Until every bit of living's done<br>
<br>
Ooh I'm <mark>burning up</mark><br>
Ooh I'm <mark>burning up</mark> with your love<br>
<br>
If there's a rhyme and reason then it's a lie<br>
Got a rainbow undercover<br>
See the missing pieces in the pale blue sky<br>
Oh they fall towards each other<br>
And I can see the light<br>
And I no longer fight<br>

Familiar and clean<br>

I got distracted just chewing on my pen<br>

Goodbye, Norma Jeane<br>
Though I never knew you at all<br>
You had the grace to hold yourself<br>
While those around you crawled<br>
They crawled out of the woodwork<br>
And they whispered into your brain<br>
They set you on the treadmill<br>
And they made you change your name<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
And it seems to me you lived your life<br>
Like a candle in the wind<br>
Never knowing who to cling to<br>
When the rain set in<br>
And I would've liked to know you<br>
But I was just a kid<br>
Your candle <mark>burned out</mark> long before<br>
Your legend ever did<br>
<br>
Loneliness was tough<br>
The toughest role you ever played<br>
Hollywood created a superstar<br>
And pain was the price you paid<br>
And even when you died<br>
Oh, the press still hounded you<br>
All the papers had to say<br>
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
Goodbye, Norma Jeane<br>
Though I never knew you at all<br>
You had the grace to hold yourself<br>
While those around you crawled<br>
Goodbye, Norma Jeane<br>
From the young man in the 22nd row<br>
Who sees you as something more than sexual<br>
More than just our Marilyn Monroe<br>

Lord Byron had a lot of luggage<br>

He didn't get to bathe very often<br>
But he liked to change his clothes all the time<br>

Who always tried to be like me<br>
He rose to the heights of this profession<br>
He was hard on his friends and family<br>

Christmas is the time to say "I love you"<br>
Share the joys of laughter and good cheer<br>
Christmas is the time to say "I love you"<br>
And a feeling that will last all through the year<br>
<br>
On the corner carolers are singing<br>
There's a touch of magic in the air<br>
From grownup to minor no one could be finer<br>
Times are hard but no one seems to care<br>
Christmas Eve and all the world is watching<br>
Santa guides his reindeer through the dark<br>
From rooftop to chimney, from Harlem to Bimini<br>
They will find a way into your heart<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
<br>
Just outside the window snow is falling<br>
But here beside the fire we share the glow<br>
Of moonlight and brandy, sweet talk and candy<br>
Sentiments that everyone should know<br>
Memories of the year that lays behind us<br>
Wishes for the year that's yet to come<br>
And it <mark>stands to reason</mark> that good friends in season<br>
Make you feel that life has just begun<br>

And hopes are shinin' brighter<br>

隔天早上被發現被聖誕老人駕駛馴鹿雪橇輾死，
爺爺卻不見悲傷的情緒，
仍然看著球賽、喝著啤酒跟表妹Mel玩牌。

Walking home from our house Christmas Eve<br>
You can say there's no such thing as Santa<br>
But <mark>as for</mark> me and Grandpa, we believe<br>
<br>
She'd been drinkin' too much eggnog<br>
And we'd begged her not to go<br>
But she forgot her medication<br>
And she staggered out the door into the snow<br>
When we found her Christmas mornin'<br>
At the scene of the attack<br>
She had hoof prints on her forehead<br>
And incriminatin' Claus marks on her back<br>
<br>

Now we're all so proud of Grandpa<br>
He's been takin' this so well<br>
See him in there watchin' football<br>
Drinkin beer and playin' cards with cousin Mel<br>
It's not Christmas without Grandma<br>
All the family's dressed in black<br>
And we just can't help but wonder:<br>
Should we open up her gifts or send them back?<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
Now the goose is on the table<br>
And the pudding made of fig<br>
And a blue and silver candle<br>
That would have just matched the hair in grandma's wig<br>

"Better watch out for yourselves<br>
They should never give a license<br>
To a man who drives a sleigh and plays with elves."<br>

Well, <mark>for one thing</mark>, there was a whole lot of guys<br>
Who would've liked to have been in my shoes<br>
But the upkeep on a woman like that<br>
Will give an old poor boy the blues<br>
<br>
Still the pleasure was worth the pain<br>
Of everything she put me through<br>
And I consider myself one of the fortunate few<br>
<br>
Yeah and another thing she wasn't just good looking<br>
Her imagination just wouldn't quit<br>
She'd make you do things you never thought about<br>
And things you wouldn't want to admit<br>
<br>
There must be somebody else out there<br>
That feels about her like I do<br>
And I consider myself one of the fortunate few<br>
<br>
It felt so good to hurt so bad<br>
The best and the worst that I ever had<br>
I know I bit off a little more than I could chew<br>
Still, I consider myself, one of the fortunate few<br>
<br>
Well, the last thing I'm gonna tell you<br>
Some things are better left unsaid<br>
A gentleman don't go talkin' about<br>
What happens in a woman's bed<br>
<br>
That's all I've got to say<br>
I'll leave the rest up to you<br>
But I consider myself one of the fortunate few<br>

She's got a smile that it seems to me<br>
Reminds me of childhood memories<br>
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky (Sky)<br>
Now and then when I see her face<br>
She takes me away to that special place<br>
And if I stared too long I'd probably <mark>break down</mark> and cry<br>
<br>
Woah-oh-oh! Sweet child o' mine<br>
Woah, oh-oh-oh! Sweet love of mine<br>
<br>
She's got eyes of the bluest skies<br>
As if they thought of rain<br>
I hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain<br>
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place<br>
Where as a child I'd hide<br>
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by<br>
<br>
Oh yeah! Woah-oh-oh-oh! Sweet child o' mine<br>
Ooh-oh, oh, oh! Sweet love of mine<br>
Woah, oh-oh-oh! Sweet child o' mine, ooh yeah<br>
Ooh! Sweet love of mine<br>

Where do we go?<br>
Where do we go now?<br>

I'm not surprised, not everything lasts<br>
I've broken my heart so many times I stopped keeping track<br>
Talk myself in, I talk myself out<br>
I get all worked up then I let myself down<br>
<br>
I tried so very hard not to lose it<br>
I came up with a million excuses<br>
I thought I'd thought of every possibility<br>
<br>
And I know some day that it'll all <mark>turn out</mark><br>
You'll make me work so we can work to work it out<br>
And I promise you kid that I'll give so much more than I get<br>
I just haven't met you yet<br>
<br>
I might have to wait, I'll never give up<br>
I guess it's half timing and the other half's luck<br>
Wherever you are, whenever it's right<br>
You'll come out of nowhere and into my life<br>
<br>
And I know that we can be so amazing<br>
And baby your love is gonna change me<br>
And now I can see every possibility<br>

And somehow I know that it'll all <mark>turn out</mark><br>
You'll make me work so we can work to work it out<br>
And promise you kid I'll give so much more than I get<br>
I just haven't met you yet<br>
<br>
They say all's fair in love and war<br>
But I won't need to fight it<br>
We'll get it right and we'll be united<br>
<br>
And I know that we can be so amazing
And being in your life is gonna change me
And now I can see every single possibility

And someday I know it'll all <mark>turn out</mark><br>
And I'll work to work it out<br>
Promise you kid I'll give more than I get, <br>
than I get, than I get, than I get<br>

Oh you know it'll all <mark>turn out</mark><br>
And you'll make me work so we can work to work it out<br>
And promise you kid to give so much more than I get yeah<br>
I just haven't met you yet<br>

I just haven't met you yet<br>
Oh promise you kid to give so much more than I get<br>

I've been going down<br>
Down into the river, baby<br>

It's something only God knows<br>
You figure it out, I can't stay<br>
Water's in the clouds<br>
Is my life about to change?<br>

Who knows, who cares<br>

Where we ran into the dead<br>
I took you by the hand<br>
Know that even with your doubts, it's ok<br>
<mark>Take into account</mark> that it's not about to change<br>

Who knows, who cares<br>

Show the world and all its people<br>
All the wonders love can bring<br>
Give us strength and understanding<br>
Give us all one song to sing<br>
Let the music play<br>
Play it loud and <mark>make</mark> it <mark>clear</mark><br>
It's time to stand up<br>
To a new world that is now so near<br>
All the walls are falling down<br>
No more children off to war<br>
If we search in our hearts<br>
All the suffering will be no more<br>
<br>
And let there be joy in the world (Let there be)<br>
And let there be no sorrow (Ah, let there be)<br>
And let there be peace on Earth (Let there be)<br>
For all God's children, let them see<br>
<br>
That love, oh love<br>
What a blessed thing, oh yeah<br>
Say it loud<br>
<mark>Make</mark> it <mark>clear</mark> today<br>
<br>
And freedom, no more lies<br>
We can save this world if we try<br>
One world I know we can make it<br>
Yes, it's only in your heart<br>
Yes, it's only in your dreams<br>
You can climb the highest mountains<br>
You can make the whole world sing<br>
Oh yeah<br>
<br>
[3x]<br>
Love, oh love<br>
What a blessed thing, oh yeah<br>
Say it loud <br>
<mark>Make</mark> it <mark>clear</mark> today<br>

(*)<br>
All my life's a circle<br>
Sunrise and sundown<br>
The moon rose through the nighttime<br>
Till the day break comes around<br>
All my life's a circle<br>
But I can't tell you why<br>
The seasons spinning round again<br>
The years keep rolling by<br>
<br>
It seems like I've been here before<br>
I can't remember when<br>
But I've got this funny feeling<br>
That I'll be back once again<br>
There's no straight lines make up my life<br>
And all my roads have bends<br>
There's no <mark>clear-cut</mark> beginnings<br>
And so far no dead-ends<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
<br>
I've found you a thousand times<br>
I guess you've done the same<br>
But then we lose each other<br>
It's just like a children's game<br>
And as I see you here again<br>
The thought runs through my mind<br>
Our love is like a circle<br>
Let's go round one more time<br>

大家都覺得她瘋了，
但她卻相信意中人會帶她到他在空中的城堡。
很多人都唱過，上面選的影片是Helen Reddy，因為畫質跟音質比較清楚，其他比較有名的是Bette Midler <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObouJCBiV1I">註</a>及Tanya Tucker<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir3gAak9LkY">註</a>，這些版本在youtube上都有音質較清晰的版本。</li>

(*)<br> 
Delta Dawn, what's that flower you <mark>have on</mark>?<br>
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?<br>
And did I hear you say he was ameetin' you here today<br>
To take you to his mansion in the sky<br>
<br>
She's forty-one and her daddy still calls her baby<br>
All the folks around Brownsville say she's crazy<br>
'Cause she walks downtown with a suitcase in her hand<br>
Lookin' for a mysterious dark-haired man<br>
In her younger days they called her Delta Dawn<br>
Prettiest woman you ever laid eyes on<br>
Then a man of low degree stood by her side<br>
And promised her he'd take her for his bride<br>

Miss Polly had a dolly who was sick, sick, sick<br>

And he knocked on the door with a rat-a-tat-tat<br>
He looked at the dolly and he shook his head<br>
And he said "Miss Polly, put her straight to bed!”<br>
He wrote on a paper for some pills, pills, pills<br>

It was summer
I did love you true
Feelin' like a fool
Fall passed by
I though you'd fade away
But you left me with the pain

(*)<br>
Winter <mark>calls for</mark> falling snow
You promised me you'd never go
And Christmas will be here
And Christmas will be here
It's the hope I'm clinging to
My Christmas was in June
My Christmas was in June
When I was still with you

December discovers
We were summer lovers
I wonder if you knew
Snow that freezes
Ocean breezes blue
A place that we once knew

(*)<br>
<br>
Broken pieces
Thrown on beaches by you
When you broke my heart in two

(*)<br>
<br>
This December
All I'll remember is you
My Christmas was in June
My Christmas was in june
My Christmas was in june
My Christmas was in june
My Christmas was in june
My Christmas was in june

La, la, da, da...<br>
<br>
We all are stranger creatures<br>
Than when we all started out as kids<br>
Culture forbids<br>
We have romantic fantasies<br>
About what dying truly is<br>
Fall off the grid<br>
<br>
We live for the night's decor<br>
It reveals what we dream of<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
I know there's someone at the door<br>
They <mark>called for</mark> help, of this I'm sure<br>
But do I want to say goodbye<br>
To all the glowing eyes?<br>
I'm holding on to what I know<br>
And what I know I must let go<br>
But I would rather play a song<br>
For the eyes to sing along<br>
<br>
The eyes to sing along, long, long<br>
<br>
We all know somebody who knows somebody who's doing great<br>
I know some people who know people who are flying straight<br>
But I'll kindly enter into rooms of depression<br>
While ceiling fans and idle hands will take my life again<br>
<br>
We live for the night's decor<br>
It reveals what we dream of<br>
<br>
(*)<br>
<br>
This room is far too dark for us to stay around<br>
Redemption's not that far, and darkness is going down<br>
This room is far too dark, for us to stay around<br>
Redemption's not that far, and darkness is going down<br>
<br>
La, la, da, da...<br>
<br>
I'm holding on to what I know<br>
And what I know I must let go<br>
But I would rather play a song<br>
For the eyes to sing along<br>
<br>
Their eyes will sing along, long, long<br>
Make them stop<br>
Make them stop<br>
Make them stop<br>
Make them stop<br>
Make them stop<br>

Marry Gus and Celia<br>
They found a golden stone<br>
They keep it in their hands and<br>
Hide it under our souls<br>
To keep us warm<br>
<br>
They promised to the waters<br>
They promised to the fall<br>
That they would breath as one<br>
And whisper to us all<br>
Their joy<br>
<br>
Oh! they exchanged their hearts in the dark<br>
In the womb they <mark>called for</mark> a song<br>
For a joyful kiss<br>
<br>
Marry Gus and Celia<br>
With a golden choir<br>
Singing out their names and<br>
Burning like a fire, to make us cry<br>
<br>
Cause tears of tigers sooth us<br>
Shimmering in the night<br>
They reach us with a smile and<br>
Carry us with a sigh<br>
To make us cry for joy<br>
<br>
Oh! they exchanged their hearts in the dark<br>
In the womb they <mark>called for</mark> a son<br>
In the womb they <mark>called for</mark> a son<br>
In the womb they <mark>called for</mark> a son<br>
In the womb they <mark>called for</mark> a son<br>
For a joyful kiss<br>

I was a quick wet boy<br>
Diving too deep for coins<br>
All of your street light eyes<br>
Wide on my plastic toys<br>
Then when the cops closed the fair<br>
I cut my long baby hair<br>
Stole me a dog-eared map<br>
And <mark>called</mark> for you everywhere<br>
<br>
Have I found you? Flightless bird<br>
Jealous, weeping<br>
Or lost you? American mouth<br>
Big pill looming<br>
<br>
Now I'm a fat house cat<br>
Nursing my sore blunt tongue<br>
Watching the warm poison rats<br>
Curl through the wide fence cracks<br>
Pissing on magazine photos<br>
Those fishing lures<br>
Thrown in the cold and clean<br>
Blood of Christ mountain stream<br>
<br>
Have I found you? Flightless bird<br>
Grounded, bleeding<br>
Or lost you? American mouth<br>
Big pill, stuck going down<br>
<br>
