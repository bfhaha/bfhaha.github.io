<pre>
All you who love darkness instead of true light,
Who dare not yourselves show, except in the night.
Lament your sad loss, let the news spread afar,
The great overthrow of The Northern Star.

[Chorus]
Derry down down, derry down down,
Derry down, derry down, croppies lie down.

In the County of Wexford these rebels did rise,
All brave Orange-men they swore they'd sacrifice;
They thought that our army they surely would beat,
But we boldly attacked them, and made them retreat.

[Chorus]

On Vinegar Hill then those rebels did camp,
They thought by their numbers our army would cramp;
But we boldly attacked them and forced them to yield,
And five hundred croppies lay dead on the field.

[Chorus]

The bold General Dundas is a man of great might,
He attacked all the croppies just at the day-light;
He threw up his bomb-shells and bullets so fast,
And put the damned croppies all flying at last.

[Chorus]

Colonel Campbell, commanding the first light brigade,
He forced up the hill when the attack it was made,
And planted his cannon in such a fine spot,
And made the wild croppies to curse his grape shot.

[Chorus]

These rebels they thought our command to seduce,
They sent out McManus with a white flag of truce;
They thought that the army good terms they would give,
But the answer was, 'croppies, we won't let you live'.

[Chorus]


Then Esmond and Kay all with Harvey and Hay,
Unto General Moore were given up the next day;
They were tried by court-martial, them quickly we slew,
And that put an end to the blood-thirsty crew.

[Chorus]

You’re acting like you’re still in love
When you’re texting cause you drank too much
Don’t try to be the saint you’re not
Just because you want another shot

You think we’d be safe and sound
It’s funny you are coming back around
you loved the feeling of being in love 
Need my attention but you’ve had enough

(A)
Boy, we’re out of date,
Don’t have another heart for you to break cause
Boy, we’re out of date
Don’t have another day for you to waste

(B)
Been feeling lonely when you’re not around
But don’t you treat me like i’m lost and found

(C)
Boy, we’re out of date,
But I can’t stop myself from one more taste

I’m acting like I’m still in love
When I’m texting cause i drank too much
Don’t care if i’m a saint or not
When I'm gonna get another shot

We’ll never be safe and sound
So we better make the last one count
you loved the feeling of being in love
Need my attention but you’ve had enough

(A) One night in June big bad moon
Chinese lanterns twinkle in bright
Now what was the tune that big band was crooning
Must have been love at first sight

(B) We danced till three on the balcony
Dawn for the stars to flight
Honeysuckle breeze whispering leaves
Must have been love at first sight

(C) By now we had a while
To look each other over
We've seen what time could bring two lovers
That night at the lake was no mistake
The years disappear when you hum in my ear

Darlin
That was the tune that big band was crooning
Must have been love at first sight

Stop your running about   
Best you sort yourself out  
Stop your running around  
Taking knives out in town  

(*) 
Do you see?  
A message to the youth take heed  
A message to you  

You're growing into a man  
Kids could be on your plan  
But who are they to look up to
With a blade in your hand

(*)  

Stop your fooling around  
Guns and knives out in town  
Don't you know what you're doing  
People's lives in your hands

[2x]
Do you see?  
A message to the youth take heed  
A message to the youth take heed  
A message to you

I remember my Dad telling me as he was growing old
that he just could not comprehend how the years had flown
So many things he planned to do 
before his life on Earch was through
and passed him by he failed to take the time

(*) 
He said son don't be afraid of living 
Don't hesitate to live your life be bold
We only get one chance at life so live it
Don't put off being young until your old

Then I grew up and Dad was gone
I had to sign things on my own
My time was spent for family to provide 
My little boys most every day said Dad 
won't you please come and play
But I didn't need the words Dad said to me

(*)

Now I've grown old and all alone
My sons grew up and they are gone
I think of the many things we didn't do
Its sad that we can never learn
We make the same mistakes in turn
And I tell my sons the words Dad said to me

(*)

Oh don't put of being young until your old

(*)
Why should I feel sorry for you now
You're the one who shattered every vow
I believed in you
But you proved untrue
Why should I feel sorry for you now

I remember on that dreary day
When I begged you not to go away
But you didn't care
You left me in despair
Why should I feel sorry for you now

(*)

Why should I forgive you and forget
Scars upon my heart are not healed yet
Now my eyes are dry
It's your turn to cry
Why should I feel sorry for you now

(*)

Why should I feel sorry over you
You just laughed at me when I fell blue
Though your eyes are wet
I'm learning to forget
Why should I feel sorry for you now

There will be no other teardrops little girl
I'll change them to a smile

I'll give you the world
So put away your teardrops little girl

If I had it my way   
I'd get off highway  
And pull up in the driveway  
Taking in my arms  

But I got a job to do  
I know that you're working too 
Make a better life for you and me  

(*) Making good time on the road  
Making good time coming home  
I know you're awake there  
Seen it in my mind  
Coming on home and I'm making good time  

All I do is miss you   
Never could resist you  
I can't wait to kiss you  
Look into your eyes  

It's been a long hard drive   
But it's gonna be alright  
As I can see the hometown lights and view  

(*)x3  

Making good time
