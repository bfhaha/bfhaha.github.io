<h1><a href="http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/journal.php?jrn=em">ELEMENTE DER MATHEMATIK</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>Language: German and English</li>
<li>Country: German</li>
<li>Introduction: Elemente der Mathematik (EM) publishes survey articles about important developments in the field of mathematics; stimulating shorter communications that tackle more specialized questions; and papers that report on the latest advances in mathematics and applications in other disciplines. The journal does not focus on basic research. Rather, its articles seek to convey to a wide circle of readers - teachers, students, engineers, professionals in industry and administration - the relevance, intellectual challenge and vitality of mathematics today. The Problems Section, covering a diverse range of exercises of varying degrees of difficulty, encourages an active grappling with mathematical problems. The journal's books and software reviews are additional features that serve to keep readers attuned to what is new and exciting on all mathematical fronts. 
    <br><br>The publication language is primarily German, but many articles are in English, French or Italian.</li>

<h1><a href="https://plus.maths.org/content/">Plus Magazine</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>Language: English</li>
<li>Country: U.S.</li>
<li>Introduction: Plus is an internet magazine which aims to introduce readers to the beauty and the practical applications of mathematics. A lot of people don't have a very clear idea what "real" maths consists of, and often they don't realise how many things they take for granted only work because of a generous helping of it. Apparently, some people even have the idea that it's boring! Weird. Anyway, we hope that even if you're such a person now, you won't be after looking through one or two issues of Plus, and that you'll come back and read future issues as they come out. 
    <br><br>Plus provides articles and podcasts on any aspect of mathematics, covering topics as diverse as art, medicine, cosmology and sport, a news section, showing how recent news stories were often based on some underlying piece of maths that never made it to the newspapers, reviews of popular maths books, and puzzles for you to sharpen your wits. We have a regular interview with someone in a maths-related career, showing the wide range of uses maths gets put to in the real world. And all past content remains available online, which besides making for good browsing is, we hope, a useful resource for maths school students and teachers.</li>
</ul>

<h1><a href="http://www.pims.math.ca/resources/publications/pi-sky">Pi in the Sky</a></h1>
<ul>

<li>Introduction: Pi in the Sky magazine is primarily aimed at high-school students and teachers, with the main goal of providing a cultural context/landscape for mathematics. It has a natural extension to junior high school students and undergraduates, and articles may also put curriculum topics in a different perspective.</li>
